\title{Modeling the Circumnuclear Mediums and Accetion Rates of Quiescent Supermassive Black Holes}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We calculate the steady-state hydrodynamic profiles of hot gas in
  the nuclei of a sample of early-type quiescent galaxies.  We assume
  that mass is supplied to the circumnuclear medium (CNM) entirely by
  stellar winds according to the radial stellar profiles for each
  galaxy, while the gas is heated by a combination of shocked stellar
  winds and supernovae.  Our analytic and numerical results are used
  to estimate the accretion rates onto the central supermassive black
  holes (SMBH) as a function of the SMBH mass $M_{\bullet}$ and the
  heating efficiency, the latter of which is related schematically to
  the age of the stellar population, the frequency of supernovae, and
  the efficacy of accretion feedback processes.  For a fixed heating
  efficiency, we find that the SMBH accretion Eddington factor
  increases with the SMBH mass, $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd} \propto
  M_{\bullet}^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 0.5, 1$ for cusp and core
  nuclei, respectively.
  % However, considering the potentially lower heating efficiency of low
  % mass SMBHs (due to a younger stellar population and the rareity of
  % supernovae within the stagnation radius) and their resulting higher
  % susceptibility to cooling instability, we find a flatter
  % relationship $\alpha \approx 0$. 
  Our results are used to check previous estimates of the SMBH
  accretion rate assuming Bondi accretion and extrapolating the X-ray
  measured density and temperature to the unresolved Bondi radius.  We
  also discuss the implications of our results for the diversity of
  CNM environments encountered by the jetted outflows from tidal
  disruption events, and for the use of an assumed
  $\dot{M}-M_{\bullet}$ relationship to constrain the occupation
  fraction of SMBHs in low mass galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%% Maybe active galaxies constitute 10% need reference here?
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) lurk in the centers of most, if not
all nearby galaxies (see reviews by,
e.g. \citealt{KormendyRichstone:1995a};
\citealt{FerrareseFord:2005a}). However, only a few percent of these
manifest themselves as luminous Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).  Nearly
quiescent SMBHs, such as those hosting low luminosity AGN, constitute
a silent majority (e.g.~\citealt{Ho:2009a}).

In order to understand why most SMBHs appear to be inactive, it is
necessary to understand their gaseous environments.  Hot gas near the
SMBH sphere of influence (the `circumnuclear medium' or CNM) controls
the central mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$.  Better knowledge of how
$\dot{M}$ varies with the SMBH mass $\Mbh$ and other properties of the
galactic nucleus is necessary to understand the co-evolution of SMBHs
and their host galaxies with cosmic time.  SMBH growth in the low
redshift universe, for instance, appears to be dominated by low mass
black holes (e.g.~\citealt{Heckman+04}).  Although this is often
attributed to cosmological ``down sizing" (e.g, \citealt{Gallo+08}),
the physical processes involved may be distinct from those operating
at higher SMBH masses and accretion rates in quasars.

The accretion rates of low mass SMBHs and their resulting nuclear
X-ray luminosities $L_X$ also have implications for observational
constraints on their occupation fraction in low mass galaxies and the
possible existence of intermediate mass black holes.
\citet{MillerGallo+:2014a} combine the relationship between $\Mbh$ and
$L_X$ from a sample of relatively high mass galaxies
(\citealt{Gallo+08}) with upper limits on $L_X$ in several lower mass
galaxies, to infer tentative evidence for an occupation fraction less
than unity.  However, this method relies on extrapolating a power-law
fit to the $L_X-\Mbh$ distribution to low $\Mbh$, below the
instrumental detection threshold.  The conclusions of
\citet{MillerGallo+:2014a} are thus sensitive to possible changes in
the $L_X$-$\Mbh$ relationship at small $\Mbh$.
% AG: In our model we obtain a steeper relationship, but we have difficulty matching the observed relationship above the detection threshold

The density profile of the CNM also influences the emission from
stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs), such as the high energy
transient {\it Swift} J1644+57 (\citealt{Levan+11};
\citealt{Bloom+11}, \citealt{Burrows+11}; \citealt{Zauderer+11}).
This event was powered by a transient relativistic jet, which produced
synchrotron radio emission as the jet material was decelerated by
shock interaction with the CNM of the previously quiescent SMBH
(\citealt{Giannios&Metzger11}; \citealt{Zauderer+11}).  Detailed
modeling of {\it Swift} J1644+57 showed that the CNM density was
significantly lower than that measured surrounding Sgr A$^{\star}$
(\citealt{Metzger+12}; \citealt{Berger+12}).  However, a TDE jet
injected into a denser CNM would be decelerated more rapidly,
producing substantially different radio emission than in {\it Swift}
J1644+57.  Variations in the properties of the CNM could thus in
principle help explain why most TDEs appear to be radio quiet
(e.g.~\citealt{Bower+13}; \citealt{VanVelzen+13}).

Gas that forms the CNM of a SMBH may originate from several sources
(\citealt{Ho:2009a}): (1) wind mass loss from (predominantly evolved)
stars; (2) star-star collisions; (3) the unbound debris from TDEs.
Stellar wind mass loss is probably the dominant source in most cases
insofar as collisions are relevant only in very dense stellar
environments for young stellar populations (\citealt{Rubin&Loeb11}),
while TDEs are estimated to provide a subdominant contribution to the
time-averaged accretion rate of quiescent SMBHs
(\citealt{MacLeod+13}).

\citet{Ho:2009a} calculates the accretion rates onto a sample of
early-type galaxies both by using X-ray observations to determine the
Bondi accretion rate, and by estimating the contributions from the
mass loss of evolved stars.  Both methods lead him to conclude that
the available reservoir of gas is more than sufficient to power
low-luminosity AGN, assuming the standard radiative efficiency $\eta
\sim 0.1$ for thin disk accretion.  Indeed, there is now strong
observational evidence that the low levels of AGN activity in
quiescent galaxies results from accretion proceeding in a radiatively
inefficient mode (\citealt{Yuan&Narayan14}), either due to the
gravitationally-released energy being advected across the SMBH horizon
(e.g.~\citealt{Narayan&Yi95}) or due to only a fraction of the gas
inflowing on large scales ultimately reaching the SMBH
(e.g.~\citealt{Blandford&Begelman99}; \citealt{Li+13}).

The accretion rates of SMBHs can in principle be estimated directly by
assuming Bondi accretion and using {\it Chandra} X-ray observations to
estimate the gas temperature and density near the Bondi radius.  This
technique has led to the intriguing result that the Bondi accretion
power correlates with the AGN jet power (e.g.,
\citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a}; \citealt{Russell+13};
\citealt{FujitaKawakatu+:2014a}), the latter estimated from the energy
required to inflate the observed cavities within the X-ray emitting
gas.  It is, however, almost never possible to resolve the Bondi
radius, thus requiring all such studies to extrapolate the observed
gas temperature and density profiles to much smaller radial scales.
%In fact, the temperature profile is assumed to be flat inside of the
%Bondi radius.  In reality, the cusp in the velocity dispersion near
%the SMBH, should cause a cusp in the gas temperature profile (assuming
%the kinetic energy of stellar winds is efficiently thermalized in
%shocks).
%% AG-give sense of scale.

Another approach to determine the SMBH accretion rate, which we adopt
in this paper, is to directly calculate the density, velocity and
temperature profiles of the CNM using a physically motivated
hydrodynamic model.  Mass is injected to the nuclear environment via
stellar winds, while energy input results from a number of sources,
such as wind shock heating and supernovae (e.g.,
\citealt{Quataert:2004a,De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).
Unlike previous works, however, which focus on modeling the nuclei of
individual galaxies, here we systematically analyze the properties of
the CNM across a large sample of quiescent galaxies with a range of
SMBH masses and other properties (\citealt{WangMerritt:2004a};
hereafter WM04).  For each galaxy, stellar winds deposit mass and
energy across a range of radii calculated directly from the observed
{\it stellar} density profile.

The one-dimensional steady state flow of gas is usually characterized
by an inflow-outflow structure, with a critical radius known as the
``stagnation radius" $\rs$ where the radial velocity goes to zero.
Mass loss from stars interior to the stagnation radius is accreted,
while that outside $\rs$ is unbound in an outflow from the nucleus.
The stagnation radius, rather than the Bondi radius, is thus
ultimately responsible for setting the SMBH accretion rate, although
$\rs$ can in many cases lie within a factor of few of the
nominal Bondi radius.
% Furthermore, in some cases we find that no stagnation
% radius exists at all; this formally implies that the entire of ISM of
% the galaxy is feeding the SMBH, potentially resulting in much higher
% accretion rate than would be predicted by simple Bondi accretion. 
The main goal of our analysis is to provide a framework for
interpreting the properties of quiescent galactic nuclei given the
comparatively well understood physics of stellar winds and supernova
heating.

This paper is organized as followed.  In $\S\ref{sec:model}$ we
describe our model, including the sample of galaxies used in our
analysis ($\S\ref{sec:sample}$) and our numerical procedure for
calculating the steady-state hydrodynamic profile of the CNM
($\S\ref{sec:hydro}$).  In $\S\ref{sec:results}$ we describe our
results.  In $\S\ref{sec:applications}$ we describe applicaiton of our
results, including a comparison of our gas profiles to those inferred
from {\it Chandra} observations and to the measured $L_X-\Mbh$
relationship.  In $\S\ref{sec:discussion}$ we discuss our results.  In
$\S\ref{sec:summary}$ we summarize our results.
\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}
\subsection{Galaxy models}
\citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} use Hubble WFPC2 imaging to measure the
radial surface brightness profiles for hundreds of nearby early type galaxies. The measured surface brightness profile is generally well-fit by a ``Nuker" law parameterization:
\begin{equation}
  I(\xi)=I_b 2^{(\beta-\Gamma)/\alpha} \xi^{-\Gamma} (1+\xi^\alpha)^{-(\beta-\Gamma)/\alpha}, \,\,\,\xi\equiv\frac{r}{r_b}.
\end{equation}

The Nuker profile is a broken power law which transitions from an inner power law slope, $\Gamma$, to an outer power law slope, $\beta$, at a break radius, $\rb$.  Assuming spherical symmetry, this corresponds to a stellar density $\rhostar \sim r^{-1-\Gamma}$ for $r \ll \rb$ and $\rhostar\sim r^{-1-\beta}$ for $r \gg \rb$, thus motivating us to adopt a broken power-law profile
\begin{align}
\rho_\star = 
\begin{cases}
\rho_\star(\rsoi) \left(r/\rsoi\right)^{-1-\Gamma} & r \leq r_b\\
\rho_\star(r_b) \left(r/r_b\right)^{-1-\beta} & r > r_b,
\label{eq:rhostar}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\rho_\star(\rsoi)$ is the stellar density at the radius of the black hole sphere of influence, 
\be
\rsoi \simeq G \Mbh/\sigma^2 \approx 14 M_{\bullet,8}^{0.6}\,{\rm pc},
\label{eq:rsoi}
\ee
and the final equality in (\ref{eq:rsoi}) employs a recent version of the $\Mbh-\sigma$ relationship (\citealt{Gultekin+09}),
 \begin{align}
M_{\bullet} \simeq 2\times 10^{8}\left(\frac{\sigma}{200\,{\rm
      km\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{5.1}M_{\odot}.
\label{eq:Msigma}
\end{align}
Although the use of equation (\ref{eq:Msigma}) is questionable for low mass black holes (e.g., \citealt{Greene&Ho07}), our results are not overly sensitive to this assumption.  

A galaxy model is fully specified by four parameters: $\Mbh$, $\Gamma$, $r_b$,
and $\beta$.  We compute models for three different black hole masses, $\Mbh = 10^6$, $10^7$, $10^8 \Msun$.  The distribution of $\Gamma$ in the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} sample is bimodal, with a concentration of ``core" galaxies with $\Gamma \lsim 0.3$ and a concentration of ``cusp" galaxies with $\Gamma \gsim 0.7$.  We bracket these possibilities by considering models with $\Gamma=0.8$ and $\Gamma=0.1$.  Since we are generally interested in properties of the gas flow on radial scales $\ll r_b$, we fix $\beta = 2$ (a typical value), an assumption to which most of our results is not sensitive.  However, the presence of $\rb$ is necessary for to obtain a converged steady state for some regions of our parameter space. We adopt $\rb=100$ pc for cusp galaxies ($\Gamma=0.8$), while for core galaxy models we employ the scaling relation $\rb = $, motivated again by the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} sample. ({\bf BDM: fill in!}).  Though simplistic, our results are not sensitive to our assumption about the value of $\rb$.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic Equations}
\label{sec:hydro}

Following \citet{Quataert:2004a} (see also \citealt{HolzerAxford:1970a,De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}), we calculate the gas density profile $\rho$ of the CNM for each galaxy model by solving the equations of one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) time-dependent hydrodynamics,
\begin{align}
  &\drhodt+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r^2 v\right)=q \label{eq:drhodt}\\
  &\rho \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial
      v}{\partial r}\right) =-\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}- \rho\frac{GM_{\rm enc}}{r^{2}} -q v \label{eq:dvdt}\\
  &\rho T\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial
      s}{\partial r}\right)=q\left[\ke+\kew-\gammaf \cs \right] +\nabla\cdot(\kappa \nabla T)
, 
\label{eq:dsdt}
\end{align}
where $v$, $T$, $p$ and $s$ are the radial velocity, temperature,
pressure and specific entropy of the gas, respectively, and $M_{\rm enc} = M_{\star}(r) + \Mbh$ is the
enclosed mass.  We assume an ideal gas equation of state with $p =
\rho kT/\mu m_p$ with $\mu = 0.62$  and $\gamma = 5/3$. {\bf BDM: take $\mu = 0.62$ here for fully ionized gas - what did you do?}

The source term in the continuity equation (eq.~[\ref{eq:drhodt}]),
\begin{align}
  q=\frac{\eta \rhostar}{\th},
\label{eq:q}
\end{align}
represents mass input from stellar winds, which we parameterize in
terms of the fraction $\eta$ of the stellar density $\rhostar$ being
recycled into gas on the Hubble time $\th = 1.4 \times 10^{10}$
years.  To good approximation $\eta\simeq 0.02 (t_{\star}/t_h)^{-1.3}$ at time $t_{\star}$ following a burst of star formation (e.g., \citealt{Ciotti+91}),\footnote{\citet{Ciotti+91} give the overall mass return rate from evolved stars as a function of B-band luminosity.  Although we give the mass return rate per unit volume, our expressions are equivalent.} although $\eta$ is higher in cases of ongoing star formation.  

Source terms $\propto q$ also appear in the momentum and entropy equations (eqs.~[\ref{eq:dvdt}] and [\ref{eq:dsdt}]) because isotropic mass injection in the SMBH rest frame represents a source of momentum and energy relative to the mean flow.  Physically, these result from the mismatch between the properties of virialized gas injected locally by stellar winds and the mean properties of the background flow.   The term $\propto -q c_{s}^{2}$ turns out to be an important in stabilizing the flow to runaway cooling ($\S$).

The last term in equation (\ref{eq:dsdt}) accounts for heat transportation by electron conductivity, where $\kappa_{\rm eff}=\kappa_{\rm spitz}/(1+\psi)$ (\citealt{DaltonBalbus:1993a}) is the conducitivity and $\kappa_{\rm spitz} = \kappa_0 T^{5/2}$ is the classical \citet{Spitzer62} value ($\kappa_0\simeq 2\times 10^{-6}$ in cgs units).  The flux limitor $\psi = \kappa_{\rm spitz} \nabla T/(5\phi \rho c_s^3)$ saturates the conductive flux if the mean free path for electron coulomb scattering becomes comparable to the temperature length scale, where $c_s \equiv (kT/\mu m_p)^{1/2}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $\phi \lesssim 1$ is an uncertain dimensionless constant (we adopt $\phi = XXX$).  Even a weak magnetic field perpendicular to the flow could in principle suppress the conductivity.  However, the radially-decreasing temperature profiles of interest are susceptible to the magneto-thermal instability (\citealt{Balbus01}), the non-linear evolution of which is believed to result in a radially-directed field structure (\citealt{Parrish&Stone07}).

The term $\propto \vw^2 = \sigma(r)^2+v_{w,0}^2$ in the entropy equation accounts for external heating sources (e.g., \citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  The first term accounts for the minimum shock heating of the stellar winds due to the random movement of stars with respect to each other at the characteristic velocity $\sim \sigma = \sqrt{GM_{\rm enc}/r}$, as is present even for the low wind velocities $\ll \sigma$ that characterize AGB mass loss in old stellar populations.  The second term, $v_{w,0}^{2}$, parameterizes the contribution of additional sources of heating, such as faster main sequence or Wolf-Rayet winds, millisecond pulsars, supernovae, AGN feedback, etc.  As discussed in $\S\ref{sec:heating}$, the value of $v_{w,0}$ is uncertain and will in general depend on the SMBH mass and the age of the stellar population.

Equations (\ref{eq:drhodt})-(\ref{eq:dsdt}) are solved using a sixth
order finite difference scheme with a third order Runge-Kutta scheme
for time integration and artificial viscosity terms in the velocity
and entropy equations for numerical stability (\citealt{Brandenburg:2003a}).  We solve the equations for different choices of $v_{\rm w,0} = 300, 600, 1200$ km s$^{-1}$ spanning a physically plausible
range.  Although we are interested in the steady-state intflow/outflow structure, the time-dependent equations are solved to avoid numerical issues that arise near the critical sonic points, of which there are up to two because of the supersonic inflow on small radial scales and a possible supersonic outflow on large scales.

Radiative cooling is not included in our calculation.  Across much of the parameter space radiative cooling is subdominant compared to other sources of cooling.  Radiative cooling cannot be neglected when $\vwO$ is low (and/or $\eta$ is high), but once important it leads to thermal instabilities (e.g.~\citealt{McCourt+12}) which our 1D time-independent model cannot account for self-consistently anyways.  Indeed, one of the main goals of this work is to use our analytic and numerical solutions neglecting radiation to ascertain over what physical conditions cooling instabilities are likely to develop ($\S\ref{sec:cooling}$).

The accuracy of our numerical solutions is assessed by checking the level of conservation of mass across the grid, as well as the integral constraint on the energy.  Mass and energy are conserved to $\lesssim
40$ per cent for all solutions presented in this paper. 
{\bf BDM: more details...}


\section{Results}

We begin by describing useful analytic results before presenting our numerical solutions.  

\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Analytic Results}

Here we summarize analytic estimates of physical quantities, such as the stagnation radius $\rs$ and the mass accretion rate, the detailed derivation of which are given in Appendix \ref{app:rs}.  Our results are expressed in terms of the SMBH mass $M_{\bullet} = 10^{8}M_{\bullet,8}M_{\odot}$ and the wind heating parameter (eq.~[\ref{eq:dsdt}])
\begin{eqnarray}
v_{\rm w} = v_{\rm w,0}\left(1+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{v_{\rm w,0}^{2}}\right)^{1/2} 
 \approx v_{\rm w,0}\left(1+0.14 \Mbheight^{0.43}v_{500}^{-1}\right)^{1/2},
\end{eqnarray}
where the parameter $\vwO = 500 v_{500}$ km s$^{-1}$ accounts for wind heating beyond the baseline level produced by the winds of old stars, and the final equality makes use of $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:Msigma}]).

\subsubsection{Flow Properties Near the Stagnation Radius}

Continuity of the entropy derivative at the stagnation radius demands that the temperature at the stagnation radius is given by (Appendix \ref{app:rs})
\begin{align}
T \simeq \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\frac{\mu m_p v_{w}^{2}}{2} \approx 3.7
\times 10^6\ \, v_{500}^2 \,\,{\rm K} 
\label{eq:Tanalytic}
\end{align}
%{\bf BDM: i picked $\mu = 0.62$ and stick to it.}

Hydrostatic equilibrium can be used to determine the location of the stagnation radius where $v = 0$ (Appendix \ref{app:rs})
\begin{align}
  \frac{\rs}{\rsoi}=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2 v_{w,0}^{2} n}\left[
   \frac{\Mstar(\rs)}{\Mbh}\left(\frac{9-\Gamma}{2}-n\right)+\left(\frac{7}{2}-n\right)\right],
 \label{eq:stag_analytic}
\end{align}
in terms of the radius of the sphere of influence (eq.~[\ref{eq:rsoi}]), where $n$ is the power-law slope of the
density profile at $r = r_{\rm s}$, and A and B are constants that depend on the Nuker
parameter $\Gamma$ and the adiabatic index of the gas.

If the SMBH dominates the gravitational potential at the stagnation radius ($M_{\bullet} \gg M_{\star}$; $v_{w,0} \gg \sigma$) then equation (\ref{eq:stag_analytic}) simplifies greatly
\begin{align}
  &\rs=\frac{7}{2}\frac{G \Mbh}{n \vwO^2} \approx 6
 \, \pc \,\, \Mbheight v_{500}^{-2},
  \label{eq:stag_simple}
\end{align}
where the numerical estimate assumes $n = 1$.  This expression is similar to that obtained by \citet{Volonteri+11} on heuristic grounds (their equation~[6]).  In the opposite limit when the wind heating is weaker ($v_{\rm w,0} \ll \sigma$), the stagnation radius moves to very large radii or may not exist at all.  

\subsubsection{SMBH Accretion Rate}

The SMBH accretion rate is given by the integrated mass loss rate interior to the stagnation radius (eq.~[\ref{eq:q}]), 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dot{M} &=& \frac{\eta \Menc(\rs)}{\th} \nonumber \\
&\approx&
  \begin{cases}
    2.9 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{1.76}
    v_{500}^{-3.8}  \eta_{0.02} \Msun \, \pyear& \text{core} \\
    5.3 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{1.48} 
    v_{500}^{-2.4}  \eta_{0.02} \Msun \, \pyear  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:mdot_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have made use of equation (\ref{eq:stag_simple}), i.e. assuming that $v_{w,0} \gg \sigma$.  The resulting Eddington ratio $\eddr$ is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\dot{M}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} &\approx&
  \begin{cases}
    1.3 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.76}
    v_{500}^{-3.8}  \eta_{0.02}   & \text{core} \\
    2.4 \times 10^{-5} \Mbheight^{0.48} 
    v_{500}^{-2.4}  \eta_{0.02}   & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:eddr_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}

The gas density at the stagnation radius $\rho(r_{\rm s})$ is more challenging to estimate.  Its value can be crudely estimated using equation (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}) in conjunction with an alternative estimate of $\dot{M}$ as the gaseous mass within the stagnation radius divided by the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff}(\rs) = (r_{\rm s}^{3}/GM_{\bullet})^{1/2}$, viz.
\begin{align}
  &\dot{M}\sim\frac{(4 \pi/3) \rs^3 \rho(\rs)}{\tff(\rs)},
  \label{eq:mdot_gas}
\end{align}
from which one derives 
\begin{align}
  \rho(\rs)\approx
  \begin{cases}
    5 \times 10^{-26} \Mbheight^{-0.2} v_{500}^{-0.8}  \eta_{0.02} \,
    \, {\rm g \, cm^{-3}}& \text{core},\\
    9 \times 10^{-26}  \Mbheight^{-0.5} v_{500}^{0.6}  \eta_{0.02} \,\, {\rm g \,cm^{-3}} & \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rhors}
\end{align}
again using equation (\ref{eq:rs_simple}) for the stagnation radius.  

%Note that by combining equations~\eqref{eq:mdot_analytic}
%and~\eqref{eq:mdot_gas}, one can also write
%\begin{align}
%\rho(\rs)=\frac{3 q(\rs) \tff(\rs)}{2-\Gamma}.
%\label{eq:rhors2}
%\end{align}

It is useful to compare our expression for the mass accretion rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]) to the traditional ``Bondi" rate for accretion onto a point source from an external medium of fixed density and temperature density (\citealt{Bondi52}):
\begin{align}
  \dot{M}_{\rm B} =4\pi \lambda r_b^2 \rho(r_b) v_{\rm ff}(r_b),
\label{eq:bondi}
\end{align}
where $r_b \equiv GM/c_{s}^{2}$ is the Bondi radius, $v_{\rm ff} = (GM_{\bullet}/r)^{1/2}$ and $\lambda$ is a parameter of order unity.  Rewriting equation (\ref{eq:mdot_gas}) as $\dot{M}\simeq 4\pi \rs^2 \rho(\rs) v_{\rm ff}(\rs)/3$,
we note a similarity between equation (\ref{eq:mdot_gas}) and the Bondi formula (eq.~[\ref{eq:bondi}]) if $\rb$ is replaced by $\rs$.  When the stagnation radius resides interior to the sphere of influence we indeed have (eq.~[\ref{eq:stag_simple}])
\begin{align}
  \rs\approx\frac{7}{2}\frac{G \Mbh}{\vwO^2} \approx \frac{14}{3}\frac{GM_{\bullet}}{c_{s}^{2}} = \frac{14}{3}r_{\rm B},
  \label{eq:rs_simple}
\end{align}
where the second equality makes use of equation (\ref{eq:Tanalytic}). 

\subsubsection{Importance of Heat Conduction}

The above analytic results neglect the effects of heat conduction near the stagnation radius, an assumption we now check.  The importance of conductive heating can be estimated by comparing its magnitude to the nominal level of ``wind" heating:
\begin{align}
  \left.\frac{\nabla\cdot(\kappa \nabla T)}{q v_{\rm
w}^{2}/2}\right|_{r_{\rm s}} &\sim \frac{2t_{\rm h}\kappa_0
T^{7/2}}{r_{\rm s}^{2}\eta \rho_{\star}(r_{\rm s}) v_{\rm w}^{2}(1+\phi)}
\nonumber \\ &\sim {\rm min}
  \begin{cases}
  10 \eta_{0.02}^{-1}
M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.8} v_{500}^{6.8} &  \text{unsaturated (core)}\\
 10 \eta_{0.02}^{-1}
M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.5} v_{500}^{5.4} &  \text{unsaturated (cusp)}\\
  10 \phi/(2-\Gamma) & \text{saturated},
  \end{cases}
 \label{eq:rhors}
\end{align}
where the second equality makes use of equations (\ref{eq:Tanalytic}), (\ref{eq:stag_simple}), and we have approximated $\nabla^{2} \sim 1/r_{\rm st}^{2}$, $\nabla \sim 1/r_{\rm st}$.  Because the stagnation radius is usually well inside the break radius, we have approximated the stellar density as (eq.~[\ref{eq:rhostar}])
\begin{eqnarray}
  \rho_{\star}(r_{\rm s}) &\simeq& \frac{M_{\bullet}(2-\Gamma)}{4\pi r_{\rm soi}^{3}}\left(\frac{r_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm soi}}\right)^{-1-\Gamma} \nonumber \\
 &\approx& \begin{cases}
    9.4 \times 10^{-19}M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.2}v_{500}^{2.2}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}
    & \text{core} \\
    1.1 \times 10^{-18} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.5}v_{500}^{3.6}
    \,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rhostarrs}
\end{eqnarray}
Even in the saturated case, heat conduction is at most an order unity correction for expected values of the saturation parameter $\phi < 0.3$, justifying its neglect in our analysis.  

\subsubsection{Thermal Instability}

Radiative cooling, if important, can qualitative alter key features of the flow.  Initially hydrostatic gas that cools at constant pressure $P \propto nT$ according to $\dot{q}_{\rm cool} \propto T^{-2.7}$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling}] below) is thermally unstable.  Thermal instability leads to higher black hole accretion rates and enhanced star formation which, when coupled by feed-back processes, can lead to limit cycle behavior, inconsistent with our assumption of a a steady-state flow (e.g. Ciotti refs).  

Radiative cooling can, however, be stabilized by the other source of (stable) wind cooling, such as the last term $\propto c_{s}^{2} \propto T$ in the entropy equation (eq.~[\ref{eq:dsdt}]), which at the stagnation radius equals $q v_{\rm w}^{2}/2$.  To assess the conditions for thermal stability we compare the nominal rate of wind heating to the rate of radiative cooling $\dot{q}_{\rm cool} =\Lambda(T) n^2$ at the stagnation radius,
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{q \vw^2/2}{\dot{q}_{\rm cool}}\right|_{\rm r{s}} \simeq
  \begin{cases}
   590 \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.76}v_{500}^{7.2}  &, \text{core}\\
   210 \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.48}v_{500}^{5.8}  &, \text{cusp},     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling2}
\end{align}
where we have used equations (\ref{eq:rhostarrs}) and
(\ref{eq:rhors}).  Here $n = \rho/\mu m_p$ and we have approximated the cooling function $\Lambda(T)$ assuming solar metallicity gas using piece-wise power law (\citealt{Draine:2011a}, Fig. 34.1):
\begin{align}
\Lambda(T)\simeq
  \begin{cases}
    2.3 \times 10^{-24} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{0.5} $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}&, T > 2 \times 10^7 \text{K} \\
    1.1 \times 10^{-22} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{-0.7}  $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}&, T < 2 \times 10^7 \text{K}     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling2}
\end{align}
There thus exists a critical minimum wind velocity required for thermal stability at the stagnation radius
\begin{align}
v_{\rm crit} \simeq
  \begin{cases}
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.14} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.11}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}  &, \text{core}\\
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.17} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.08}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}   &, \text{cusp},     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling2}
\end{align}
In $\S\ref{sec:numerical}$ we will show that $v_{w} \gtrsim v_{\rm crit} \sim 200-300$ km s$^{-1}$ is generally a condition for stability at all radii, not just at the stagnation radius.  Our estimate in equation (\ref{eq:cooling2}) assumes the existence of a stagnation radius according to equation (\ref{eq:rs}), the validity of which requires $v_{\rm w} \gtrsim \sigma \sim v_{\rm crit}$.    

If cooling becomes important in the flow ($v_{w} < v_{\rm crit}$), it may lead to thermal instabilities.  There are two kinds of ``instabilities", global and local.  The global instability is simply that, if cooling becomes very rapid, the gas loses thermal pressure and starts to inflow faster, i.e. the entire CNM accretes.  In
practice this should could manifest as a large increase in the stagnation radius, due an effective {\it decrease} in the effective heating rate.  This global ``instability" is not a true instability insofar as the gas does not necessarily clump locally into low-T clouds.

However, \citet{McCourt+12} argue that even if cooling is exactly balanced by heating everywhere, there is still a local thermal instability that operates to turn hot gas into cold clouds.  However, this local instability only causes a significant local drop-out of mass from the hot medium (to low-T clouds), if the cooling timescale,
\begin{align}
\frac{\tcool}{\tff} &\equiv \frac{3\rho k T/2 \mu \mp}{\dot{q}_{\rm cool}} \approx \frac{9}{5} \left. \frac{q \vw^2/2}{\dot{q}_{\rm cool}}\right|_{\rs}
\end{align} 
is locally shorter than the approximately 10 times the free-fall
timescale $t_{\rm ff}$, where the last equality is evaluated at the stagnation radius and makes use of equations~(\ref{eq:Tanalytic}) and (\ref{eq:rhors2}).  We thus see that the condition $v_w \gtrsim v_{\rm crit}$ is also the condition for local instability, although the prefactor may be slightly different.



% For each of our galaxies Table \ref{tab:eta} provides the maximum value of $\eta$ such that $H/C >$1 at all radii.  Roughly speaking, this is the maximum $\eta$ for which it would be safe to ignore cooling.  If cooling is important, the CNM is likely to be thermally unstable, resulting in the formation of a cold medium that could substantially enhance the rate of accretion onto the SMBH.  

%\begin{align}
 % \Lambda(T)\simeq
  %\begin{cases}
   % 2.3 \times 10^{-24} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{0.5} $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}& \text{if } T \gsim 2 \times 10^7 \text{K} \\
   % 1.1 \times 10^{-22} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{-0.7}  $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}& \text{if } T \lsim 2 \times 10^7 \text{K}     
  %\end{cases}
  %\label{eq:cooling}
%\end{align}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cooling.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:cooling} Ratio of heating ($H$) to cooling rate
    ($C$) for each of our solutions (solid lines). The cooling rate is
    calculated using the approximate (solar metallicity) cooling
    function in Equation~(\ref{eq:cooling}). The heating rate is
    estimated as $q \vw^2/2+q v^2/2$. The ratio is computed from
    equation (\ref{eq:cooling}) assuming a stellar mass loss rate
    parameter $\eta=0.02$. We also plot the ratio $\tcool/\tff$
    vs. radius. $H/C$ is a diagnostic for global thermal stability,
    and a solution should be stable as long as
    $H/C\gsim1$. $\tcool/\tff$ is a diagnostic for local thermal
    instability, solutions should be stable as long as $\tcool/t_{\rm
      ff}\gsim$10 \citealt{McCourt+12}. Notice that for high $\vwO$
    the two ratios coincide at $\rs$ (marked with a square for each
    solution).}

\subsection{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical}

This section describes the results of our numerical calculations and tests the accuracy of the analytic expressions provided in the previous section.  Numerical solutions are calculated for each galaxy for three different values of the stellar wind heating parameter $v_{w,0}$ = 300, 600, 1200 km s$^{-1}$.  

Figure~\ref{fig:profiles} shows profiles of the density $\rho(r)$,
temperature $T(r)$, and radial velocity $|v(r)|$, for the cusp
($\Gamma=0.8$) solutions within our grid.  As expected, the gas
density increases towards the SMBH $\rho\propto r^{-n}$ with
$n\simeq1$.  Note that this is shallower than the $-3/2$ power law for
Bondi accretion. However, the power law behavior does not extend
through all radii, and the gas density profile has a break coincident
with the location of the break in the stellar light profile ($\rb=100$
pc). The temperature profile is relatively flat at large radii, but
increases as $\propto 1/r^{k}$ interior to the sphere of influence,
where $k$ is smaller than 1--the power expected for virialized gas.
The inwardly directed velocity increases towards the hole approaching
The inwardly directed velocity is steeper than what would be expected
for the free-fall velocity $v \propto v_{\rm ff}\propto r^{-1/2}$.
% {\bf BDM: I made this up - in general we need
%   more explanation of what the plots are actually showing, with some
%   physical explanation.}
% AG -- things are not quite approaching Bondi on the inner grid. I
% don't have a good physical explanation yet...


Figure~\ref{fig:stag} (top panel) shows numerical results for the
stagnation radius $r_{\rm s}$ where the radial velocity goes to zero
(expressed in ratio to the radius of the SMBH sphere of influence
$r_{\rm soi}$), with different colors representing different values of
$v_{w,0}$.  Cusp and core galaxies are marked with square and
triangles, respectively.

We also show the simplified analytic result corresponding to $\rs$
approximated from \eqref{eq:stag_simple} as a solid black line. For
$\vwO$, we find good agreement with the analytic prediction. However,
\eqref{eq:stag_simple} is only valid that $\Mstar(\rs) \ll \Mbh$, and
this approximation breaks down for small $\vwO$. In fact, $\rs$
diverges for smaller $\vwO$. 

{\bf AG perhaps it would be better to solve the implicit equation for
  rs/rsoi, and plot this in the top panel--assuming a fixed n of say
  1}. We may also compare our numerical results $r_{\rm s}/r_{\rm
  soi}$ an be compared directly to our analytic estimate in equation
\ref{eq:stag_analytic}.  The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:stag}
shows the fractional difference between our numerical and analytic
results for $r_{\rm s}/r_{\rm soi}$.  The good agreement provides a
useful check of the numerical results.

Fig.~\ref{fig:cooling} shows $H/C=(q \vw^2+q v^2)/2$ and $\tcool/\tff$
as a function of radius for all of our solutions. {\bf BDM: change
  plots}, with different colors denoting different values of $\vwO$.
For our highest heating rates we observe that cooling is unimportant
for all solutions across all radii--neither the local nor the global
thermal instability would be present. However,  for our smallest value
of $\vwO$=300 km s$^{-1}$ with $\Mbh=10^8 \Msun$, the solution would be
thermally unstable as $H/C<1$ and $\tcool/\tff<10$. Note that the
precise region of the parameter space which would be thermally
unstable would depend on the value of $\eta$--in
Fig.~\pageref{fig:cooling} we have chosen $\eta=0.02$, which would be
appropriate for a stellar population with $\tage\simeq \th$. This
value is on the low end of what we would physically expect for
$\eta$. 

For $\vwO=1200$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\vwO=600$ km s$^{-1}$, we have
$H/C\simeq\tcool/\tff$ at $\rs$ as expected. However, the two ratios
diverge away from $\rs$, as equation~\eqref{eq:rhors2} is not a good
approximation away from $\rs$. Similarly, it is poorer approximation
for $\vwO=300$ km s$^{-1}$. Hence, $H/C$ and $\tcool/\tff$ do not
closely match at $\rs$ for this $\vwO$. {\bf AG would be good to
  clarify the physics here a little more.}

\section{Sources of Heating}
\label{sec:heating}

Important properties such as the location of the stagnation radius, the SMBH accretion rate, and the possibility of thermal instability depend sensitively on the assumed heating rate $\propto v_{w,0}^{2}$  This section discusses individual heating sources, providing estimates of the value of $\vwO$ corresponding to each.  Before proceeding, note that $\vwO$ is related to the volumetric heating rate $e$ according to 
\begin{align}
  &\frac{q \vwO^2}{2}=e \,\,\,\Rightarrow\,\,\,\vwO = \sqrt{\frac{2 t_h e}{\eta \rhostar}}
  \label{eq:vw_eff}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Stellar winds} 
{\bf AG: This section may have to be substantially modified in light
  of our more careful analysis of stellar winds.}

Although most of the mass supplied to the CNM by stellar winds occurs
during the giant AGB phase, these winds represent a negligible heating
source compared to the random wind velocity because the wind velocity
$\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ is much less than the stellar potential
$\sigma$.

Main sequence winds, though contributing a much smaller quantity of
mass, have much higher velocities and hence contribute a
disproportionally large share of the kinetic energy of winds.
\citet{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a} estimate that $v_{\rm w,0} \sim
100-150$ km s$^{-1}$ for main sequence winds assuming a relatively old
stellar population.  On the other hand, for a very young stellar
population of age $t_{\star} \lesssim 10^{7}$ yrs the effective wind
heating from massive stars can be much greater, $\gtrsim 10^{3}$ km
s$^{-1}$.  In what follows below, we take an effective stellar wind
heating rate \be v_{\rm w,0}^{\star} = 150\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}} \ee In
Appendix \ref{app:windheat} we present a toy model for how $v_{\rm
  w,0}$ varies as a function of stellar age ({\bf BDM: Nick can
  create}).

\subsubsection{Millisecond Pulsars} Energy injection due to the spin-down of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a potentially important heating source.  If the number of MSPs per unit stellar mass is $n_{\rm msp}$ and each contributes an average spin-down luminosity $\bar{L}_{\rm sd}$, then the resulting heating per unit volume $e \approx L_{\rm sd}n_{\rm
  msp}\epsilon$ corresponds to an effective heating rate (eq.~ [\ref{eq:vw_eff}])
\begin{eqnarray}
  v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm MSP} &=&\left({\frac{2\epsilon t_h n_{\rm msp} \bar{L}_{\rm sd}}{\eta}}\right)^{1/2} \nonumber \\
  &\approx& 90\epsilon^{1/2}\left(\frac{\bar{L}_{\rm
        sd}}{10^{34}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{1/2}
  \eta_{0.02}^{-1/2}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}},
  \end{eqnarray}
where $\epsilon< 1$ is the thermalization efficiency of the wind.  The above estimate adopts a pulsar density $n_{\rm msp}\simeq3 \times 10^{-40} $ MSPs g$^{-1}$ motivated by the $\sim 30,000$ estimated MSPs in the Milky Way of stellar mass $6\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ (\citealt{Lorimer13}).  

From the ATNF radio pulsar catalog (\citealt{Manchester+05}), we estimate that the average spin-down luminosity of millisecond pulsars in the field (excluding those in globular clusters) to be $\bar{L}_{\rm sd} \sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in which case $v_{\rm w,0} \lesssim 100$ km s$^{-1}$ is unimportant even for $\epsilon = 1$.  For higher spin-down luminosities, $L_{\rm sd}\simeq 10^{35}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ characteristic of some Fermi-detected pulsars, then the higher value of $v_{\rm w,0} \lesssim 300$ km s$^{-1}$ makes MSP heating in principle be important for $\epsilon = 1$.  However, much lower thermalization efficiencies of $\epsilon \lesssim 0.1$ are inferred based on modeling the insterstellar mediums of globular clusters \citep{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a}.  Also, the binaries giving rise to MSPs may be disocciated by stellar interactions in the dense nuclear cluster, reducing their numbers as compared to the field population.  We thus conclude that MSPs are unlikely to be an important source of heating.  

\subsubsection{Type Ia Supernovae} 

Energy injected by Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) represents a potentially important source of heating, which unlike core collapse SNe is present even in an evolved stellar population.  Assuming that each Ia injects a thermal energy $E_{\rm Ia}$ into the interstellar medium, and that the SNe rate (per stellar mass) is given by $R_{\rm   Ia}$, then the resulting volumetric heating rate $E_{\rm Ia}R_{\rm  Ia}$ produces an effective wind heating parameter (equation~[\ref{eq:vw_eff}]) \begin{align} v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} =\sqrt{\frac{2 t_h R_{\rm Ia}
E_{\rm Ia}}{\eta}} \label{eq:vw_sne}.
\end{align} The thermal energy injected by a Ia SN $E_{\rm Ia} \simeq
\epsilon_{\rm Ia} 10^{51}$ ergs depends on the efficiency $\epsilon$
with which the initial blast wave energy is converted into bulk or turbulent
motion instead of being lost to radiation.  \cite{Thornton+98}
estimate a radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm Ia} \sim 0.1$,
depending weakly on surrounding density, but \citet{Sharma+14} argues
that $\epsilon_{\rm Ia}$ can be considerably higher, $\sim 0.4$, if
the SNe occur in a hot dilute medium, as may characterize the circumnuclear medium.

The Ia SN rate $\RateIa$ depends on the age of the stellar population, as it represent the convolution of the star formation rate and the Ia delay time distribution (DTD) divided by the present stellar mass.  In
the limit of impulsive star formation, $\RateIa$ is the DTD evaluated at the time since the star formation episode.  The observationally inferred DTD (Fig. 1 of \citealt{MaozMannucci+:2012a}) has the
approximate functional form \begin{align}
  R_{\rm Ia} =1.7\times 10^{-14}\left(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm
      h}\right)^{-1.12} M_{\odot}^{-1}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}
\label{eq:DTD}
  \end{align}
  where $\tau_{\star}$ is the time since star formation
  (c.f.~\citealt{Scannapieco&Bildsten05}). {\bf AG:I deleted the extra
    factor of $\chi$ that was hanging out here.}

From equations (\ref{eq:vw_sne}), (\ref{eq:DTD}) we thus estimate that 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
    v_{w,0}^{\rm Ia} &\approx& 700(\epsilon_{\rm
      Ia}/0.4)^{0.5}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.56}\eta_{0.02}^{-1/2}\,{\rm km
      \,s^{-1}} \nonumber \\
&\approx& 700(\epsilon_{\rm
      Ia}/0.4)^{0.5}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.09}\,{\rm km
      \,s^{-1}},
\label{eq:vIa}
  \end{eqnarray}
where in the second line we have taken $\eta\simeq 0.02 (\tau_{\star}/t_h)^{-1.3}$ for a single burst of star formation (\citealt{Ciotti+91}).

The high value of $v_{w,0}^{\rm Ia}$ implies that Ia SNe represent a potentially dominant source of non-AGN heating in the CNM.  However, SNe can only be approximated as being a constant heating source throughout space and time if the rate of SNe is rapid compared to the inflow time at the radius of interest (\citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  To estimate when this approximation is valid, we estimate the ``Ia radius"
  \begin{align}
    r_{\rm Ia} \sim \left(\frac{G}{R_{\rm Ia}\sigma}\right)^{1/2} \sim
    38 M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.56}\,{\rm pc}
    \label{eq:rIa}
  \end{align}
as the location exterior of which the time interval between subsequent supernovae $\tau_{\rm Ia} \sim 1/M_{\rm enc}R_{\rm Ia} \sim G/r\sigma^{2}R_{\rm Ia}$ exceeds the local dynamical timescale $t_{\rm
dyn} \sim r/\sigma$, where we again adopt the Ia rate for an old stellar population and in the final equality we estimate the velocity dispersion using the $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ relationship
(equation~[\ref{eq:Msigma}]).  Between subsequent supernovae, stars release a gaseous mass $M_{\rm gas} \approx \eta M_{\star}\tau_{\rm Ia}/t_{\rm h}$ interior to the Ia radius, which is gravitationally bound to the SMBH by an energy $E_{\rm bind} \approx M_{\rm gas}\sigma^{2}$.  Thus, according to the above definitions, $E_{\rm Ia}/E_{\rm bind} \sim (v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia})^{2}/2\sigma^{2}$.

Assuming that $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} \gg \sigma$ then by substituting equation (\ref{eq:vIa}) into (\ref{eq:rs_simple}) we can write
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{r_{\rm Ia}}{r_{\rm s}} &\approx& 12.4M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm Ia}/0.4)^{-1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{1.68}\eta_{0.02}  \nonumber \\
&\approx& 12.4M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm Ia}/0.4)^{-1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.38}
\end{eqnarray}
Thus only for massive SMBHs $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^8 \Msun$ and/or very young populations will SNe Ia represent a steady source of heating at the nominal stagnation radius.

\subsubsection{SMBH Feedback}

Feedback from accretion onto the SMBH also represents a potentially important source of heating which is the most difficult to quantify.  A key difference between AGN heating and other sources discussed thus far is its likely dependence on the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$.  There are two types of SMBH feedback: kinetic and radiative.

Radiative feedback can be effective even in low luminosity AGN via Compton heating (e.g.,~\citealt{Gan+14}).  Compton heating provides a volumetric heating rate (\citealt{Gan+14})
\be
\dot{e}_{\rm C} = 4.1\times 10^{-35}n^{2}\xi T_{\rm C}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}},
\ee
where $\xi = L/n r^{2}$ is the ionization parameter and $L$ is the SMBH luminosity with Compton temperature $T_{\rm C} \sim 10^{9}$ K, which is assumed to be much higher than the gas temperature.  We can estimate the importance of Compton heating by assuming that $L = \epsilon \dot{M}c^{2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency and where $\dot{M}$ is estimated from equation (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}). 

Using equations (\ref{eq:rs_simple}), (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}), (\ref{eq:rhors}), (\ref{eq:rhostarrs}) we thus calculate that (eq.~[\ref{eq:vw_eff}])
\begin{align}
v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm C}  \simeq
  \begin{cases}
   125 T_{\rm C,9}^{0.5}\epsilon^{0.5}\eta_{0.02}^{0.5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.38}v_{500}^{-1.4}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}  &, \text{core}\\
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.5}T_{\rm C,9}^{0.5}\epsilon^{0.5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.24}v_{500}^{-0.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}   &, \text{cusp},     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:vC}
\end{align}
Assuming that heating were dominated by Compton heating ($v_{w} = v_{\rm w,0}^{C}$) we find that
\begin{align}
v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm C}  \simeq
  \begin{cases}
   106 \eta_{0.02}^{0.21}T_{\rm C,9}^{0.21}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.21} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.16}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}  &, \text{core}\\
   76 \eta_{0.02}^{0.29}T_{\rm C,9}^{0.29}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.29} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.14}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}   &, \text{cusp},     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:vC2}
\end{align}
where $\epsilon_{-2} = \epsilon/0.01$.  So, unless we have high $\eta$ then Compton heating will not be sufficient to stabilize the flow.


Kinetic feedback occurs in the form of an mass outflow or jet from the viscinity of the black hole, which deposits its energy at much larger radii.  We assume that the total heating rate from the SMBH is $\epsilon_{\rm j} \dot{M}c^{2}$, where $\epsilon_{\rm j} < 1$ is an efficiency factor.  If this energy is deposited uniformly out to a radius $r_{\rm heat}$ and volume $V_{\rm heat}$, then the local heating rate $e = \epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}/V_{\rm heat}$ results in an effective wind heating rate of
\be
v_w^{\bullet} \approx  \left(\frac{2t_{\rm h}\epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}}{V_{\rm heat}\eta \rho_{\star}}\right)^{1/2} \sim \left(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}t_{\rm h}}{\eta M_{\rm enc}}\right)^{1/2} \approx c\epsilon_{\rm j}^{1/2}\left(\frac{r_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm heat}}\right)^{\beta/2},
\ee
where we have used the fact that $\dot{M} \approx \eta M_{\rm enc}(r_{\rm s})/t_{\rm h}$ and that $M_{\rm enc}(r) \propto M_{\bullet}(r/r_{\rm soi})^{\beta}$ with $\beta \approx 1-2$ for radii interior to the outer break radius.  Thus for $r_{\rm heat} \sim r_{\rm s}$, even a small heating efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm j} \sim 10^{-6}$ is sufficient for $v_{\rm w,0}^{\bullet}$ to exceed other sources of non-accretion powered heating.  

For a fixed heating radius $r_{\rm heat}$ we just see that $v_{\rm
  w,0}^{\bullet} \propto r_{\rm s}^{\beta/2} \propto v_{\rm
  w,0}^{-\beta}$, where in the last proportionality we have used
equation (\ref{eq:stag_simple}).  Hence, when SMBH heating dominates,
it may ``self-regulate" itself.

What is a physically motivated value of $r_{\rm heat}$?
\citet{Bromberg+11} show that a jet of luminosity $L_{\rm j}$ and half
opening angle $\theta_{\rm j} = 0.1$ (similar to those of AGN jets)
propagates through a gaseous mass $M_{\rm g}$ to a radius $r$ in a
timescale
\begin{eqnarray}
t_{\rm jet} &\sim& 4000\,{\rm yr}\left(\frac{{L}_{\rm j}}{10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}\right)^{-1/3}\left(\frac{r}{\rm pc}\right)^{2/3}\left(\frac{M_{\rm g}}{10^{8}M_{\odot}}\right)^{1/3} 
\end{eqnarray}
Writing $L_{\rm j} = \epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}$ and approximating $M_{\rm g} \sim \dot{M}t_{\rm ff}$ we find that the ratio of the jet crossing time to the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff} \sim r/\sigma$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\frac{t_{\rm jet}}{r/\sigma} \sim 8\times 10^{-5}\sigma_{200}^{2/3}\epsilon_{\rm j}^{-1/3},
\end{equation}
which is notably independent of radius $r$.  Thus we require $\epsilon_{\rm j} \gtrsim 10^{-12}$ for the jet to escape, and if it escapes it is free to travel a long distance. 

\subsubsection{Combined Heating Rate} 

The total heating rate $\vwO = \sqrt{v_{\rm w,0}^{\star} + v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} + v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm p} + v_{\rm w,0}^{\bullet}}$ has contributions from stellar winds, supernovae, pulsars, and SMBH feedback.  Since pulsar heating appears unlikely to contribute appreciably, and since SMBH heating is uncertain, we first focus on heating from stellar winds and supernovae.  

Figure~\ref{fig:vweff} shows an estimate of how the combined heating
depends on the age of the stellar population $\tage$ and the SMB mass
$\Mbh$.  For $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 1.5\times 10^8 (\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm
  h})^{0.5} \Msun$, SNe Ia occur sufficiently frequently within the
stagnation radius (i.e., $r_{\rm Ia} > r_{\rm s}$; eq.~[\ref{eq:rIa}])
to contribute their full heating rate.  $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} \sim
250$ km s$^{-1}$.  On the other hand, for lower mass BHs Ia SNe are
infrequent, in which case main sequence stars ($v_{\rm w,0}^{\star}
\simeq 100-150$ km s$^{-1}$) dominate the heating at most times of
interest.\footnote{Although SN Ia will still occur surrounding low
  mass SMBHs, if they are infrequent interior to the radius where the
  accretion rate is being set, then they will not affect the flow near
  the SMBH at most epochs.}  For very young stellar populations
($\tage \lsim 10^7$ years), $\vwO\simeq 1000$ km s$^{-1}$ due to
contributions from line driven winds from high mass main sequence
stars.
{\bf AG: We should mention that regime with stellar wind heating only
  is likely to be thermally unstable.}

      in the parameter space of SMBH mass $\Mbh$ and age of the
      stellar population $t_{\star}$.  We assume that stellar winds
      contribute a constant heating rate $100$ km/s. The contribution
      from SNe Ia is calculated using equation (\ref{eq:vw_sne}), with
      thermalization efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm Ia}=0.4$. The
      contribution from SNe Ia is only added if the $r_s$

      $\rIa$.  {\bf BDM: Correct for dependence of Ia heating on time!

\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

\subsection{Mass accretion rate}

For each solution we calculate the accretion rate $\dot{M}$ onto the
SMBH in units of the Eddington accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm edd}
\equiv L_{\rm edd}/0.1 c^{2}$, where $L_{\rm edd} \approx 1.4\times
10^{46}M_{\bullet,8}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  Figure~\ref{fig:mdot_mass} shows
$\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ as a function of $\Mbh$ for different
values of $\vwO =$ 300, 600 and 1200 km s$^{-1}$, and for
both core ($\Gamma$=0.1) and cusp galaxies ($\Gamma$=0.8).

Note that since we expect $\dot{M}\sim\vwO^{-2}$ for a cusp galaxy and
$\dot{M}\sim\vwO^{-4}$ for a core galaxy
(equation~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]), the mass accretion rate is
expected to be a sensitive function of the assumed heating rate.
% However, the accretion rate is proportional to the stellar mass
% enclosed inside of $\rs$, so for core galaxies $\dot{M}\sim \Mbh
% (\rs/\rsoi)^{2}$,while for cusp galaxies $\dot{M}\sim \Mbh
% (\rs/\rsoi)$.  This steeper dependence is enough to offset the
% tendency for core galaxies to have a larger $\rs/\rsoi$ for fixed
% $\eta$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:stag}). Therefore, for $\rs/\rsoi<1$ core
% galaxies would have a smaller $\dot{M}$ than cusp galaxies.  For
% $\vwO=600$ km s$^{-1}$, core galaxies have a smaller accretion rate
% for a given SMBH mass. On the other hand, if  $\rs/\rsoi>1$ (as would
% be expected for small $\vwO$), core galaxies would have a larger
% accretion rate. Thus, for $\vwO=150$ km/s, core galaxies have a large
% accretion rate for a given $\Mbh$. 

%% AG-The variation in accretion rate for w/ vw for core galaxies is comparable to that of cusp galaxies and belies the steep dependence stated above.
%% AG-Note separation of cores and cusps (at vw=1000 km/s, where there are enough core galaxies for this comparison to be made). Also, note that the spread in core galaxies is far larger.

We find that $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ tends to increase with SMBH
mass $M_{\bullet}$.  This appears to be in contradiction with the
general down sizing trend observed for SMBH accretion in the local
universe (e.g.~\citealt{Heckman+04}; \citealt{Gallo+08}), such as the
fact that for quiescent galaxies the nuclear X-ray luminosity obeys
$L_X \sim \Mbh^\alpha$, where $\alpha\simeq 0.7-0.8$
\citep{MillerGallo+:2014a}.  Our model instead predicts that $\Mdot
\sim \Mbh^{1.5-2}$, such that if $L_x\sim M$, then we would have $\L_x
\sim \Mbh^{1.5-2}$, steeper than the observed relationship. 

% This is shown in the top panel Figure~\ref{fig:bh_xray}. The
% relationship from \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a} and their detection
% upper limits are the black and blue solid lines
% respectively. The points correspond to the $\dot{M} c^2$ for our
% solutions (scaled by $5\times 10^{-7}$).  We must choose a $\vwO$ for
% each galaxy.  We select $\vwO$=200 km/s, roughly the expected level of
% heating expected from main sequence the stellar winds and MSPs. If
% $L_x \sim \Mdot^2$ the discrepancy becomes worse, as shown in the
% bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:bh_xray}, where we plot $2 \times
% 10^{-4} (\eddr) \Mdot c^2$ from our solutions with the relation from
% \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a}.


One possible solution that the wind mass loss rate $\eta$ increases
with $\Mbh$, as would be expected if low mass SMBH preferentially
hosted younger stellar populations.  Another possible explanation is
that the effective heating rate of the CNM $v_{\rm w,0}$ decreases
with decreasing SMBH mass.  This could again be due to an older
stellar population, since $v_{w,0} \propto \eta^{-1/2}$ for heating
sources such as SN Ia and millisecond pulsars.
{\bf AG given our new results on stellar wind heating as a function of
Mbh. It seems like the first statement is indeed true but I suspect
vwO actually increases for low Mbh and that this effect actually dominates.}
%, or it could be due to the fact that Ia occur too infrequently inside
%the stagnation radius for low mass black holes.
%AG-We now think that SNe Ia would become important only at the
%highest values of Mbh.
%AG-Note sure where the best place for this discussion would
%be--here or after presenting the comparisons with Miller et al.

\subsection{Comparison to Observations}
{\bf AG: I do want some discussion of reproducing the density profiles
for individual observations, but I am not sure how to do it with our
new gridded approach.}
% \subsubsection{Comparison to measured temperature and density profiles}
% \citet{AllenDunn+:2006a} use {\it Chandra} X-ray observations to infer the radial temperature and density profiles in the nuclei of nine nearby X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies.  \citet{RussellMcNamara+:2013a} performed a similar analysis with a somewhat enlarged galaxy sample.  Interestingly, these works find a correlation between the accretion rate inferred assuming Bondi accretion and the AGN jet power, which is estimated by the PdV work required to inflate observed cavities in the X-ray emitting gas.  
% % At some point it would be useful to describe the differences between
% % these two sets of observations \citealt{RussellMcNamara+:2013a}
% % tries several different extrapolation schemes for the gas density,
% % and finds that that the uncertainty in extrapolating the density
% % profile is the dominant source of uncertainty in measuring the
% % accretion rate. Find total number which overlaps once the Russell
% % galaxies are included...

% Five of the galaxies in the \citet{AllenDunn+:2006a} sample overlap with that in \citetalias{WangMerritt:2004a}.  We may thus compare our results for the $T$ and $\rho$ profiles with those inferred from observations for the overlapping galaxies.  The results of this exercise are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:allen_compare}.

% Note that we have two free parameters ($\eta$ and $\vwO$) in our
% model, which implies that we can always match the observed temperature
% and densities at at least one point.  As a general rule, we find that
% a wind heating parameter $\vwO=500$ km s$^{-1}$ gives rough agreement
% with the observed temperatures.  We now highlight results for specific
% galaxies.
% % Thus, we choose $\vwO=500$ km/s.  We choose an
% % $\eta$ so that our solution would be consistent with the observed
% % density profiles. The comparison is shown in
% %% AG-The chosen properties, in particular eta may be summarized in a table.
% %% AG-Mention rising temperature profiles on large scales.

% \begin{itemize}
% % \item \emph{NGC4486} %eta=0.2
% %   On scales of $\sim1$ kpc the density profile in
% %   \citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a} is shallower than in our model. Our model
% %   has a break in the gas density at $\sim 300$ pc--near the location
% %   of the Nuker break radius for this galaxy at 560 pc. There is an
% %   observed break in the density, but on a scale of a few kpc.

% %   The temperature is assumed to be flat from the resolution limit
% %   inwards in \citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a}. However, in our models $T$
% %   increases monotonically towards the galactic center. This increase
% %   is due to the increased velocity dispersion (and thus increased
% %   heating) towards the galactic center.

% \item \emph{NGC5813} %eta=0.1 
%   The observed density profile (\citealt{RussellMcNamara+:2013a}) is
%   shallower than our calculated density profile, which has a sharp
%   break at $\sim$0.1 kpc, the location of the break radius in the
%   Nuker profile (this is the radius where the stellar light profile
%   transitions from a shallower inner power law slope to a steeper
%   outer power law slope).

%   For this galaxy we found that we could reproduce the observed
%   temperature on large scales with $\vwO=500$ km/s. The increased
%   velocity disperision towards the galactic center results in a sharp
%   increase in $T$ at small radii, which is not captured in the
%   observations due to resolution issues.
% \end{itemize}

% %It would be nice to have error bars for the observational points in this plot...

% \subsubsection{Comparison with observed X-ray Luminosity-Mass
%   Relation}
% %Note currently I reverse-engineer the stellar mass from the black
% %hole mass inferred from M-sigma; however, it would be better to use
% %the tabulated black hole mass from the Mbh-Mbulge relation.
% Fig. 1 of \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a} plots the observed
% relationship of unresolved x-ray luminosity versus galactic stellar
% mass for a sample of quiescent galaxies. We may construct a similar
% relationship with our own sample using the inferred accretion rates
% from our solutions.  To infer an x-ray luminosity for each solution,
% we scale our calculated $\Mdot c^2$ by a constant. We pick $5\times
% 10^{-7}$, which gives x-ray luminosities comparable to
% those in \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a}. We also try an alternate
% prescription in which $L_x$ is quadratic in $\Mdot$. In particular, we
% take $L_x=2 \times 10^{-4} (\eddr) \Mdot c^2$. 

% We must make choose a $\vwO$ for each galaxy.  We select $\vwO$=200
% km/s if $\rs<\rIa$ for this solution, $\vwO$=500 km/s if $\rs>\rIa$
% for this solution, or exclude it.  At low $\Mbh$ we have $\vwO$=200
% km/s and at high $\Mbh$ we have $\vwO$=500 km/s.  Note that much of
% our sample is excluded in this Fig., since for $\vwO$=200 km/s we
% would have $\rs>\rIa$ and four $\vwO$=500 km/s we would have
% $\rs<\rIa$ (i.e. the relative locations of $\rs$ and $\rIa$ would be
% inconsistent with the assumed level of heating).

% %AG-power law may be closer to 1.4 & 1.8 than to 1.5 & 2.
% Our results are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:bh_xray}. In our model
% there is a steeper dependence $\Mbh$ on $M_{\rm gal}$ than in
% \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a}. We find $L_x \propto M_{\rm gal}^{1.5}$ when
% $L_x \propto M_{\rm gal}^{2}$, whereas \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a} finds
% that $L_x \propto M_{\rm gal}^{0.7-0.8}$.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Demographics of SMBHs}

Our analytic expression for the accretion rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]) can be translated into the growth time of the SMBH $t_{\rm grow} \equiv M_{\bullet}/\dot{M}$,
\begin{eqnarray}
  t_{\rm growth}/t_{\rm h} \approx 
  \begin{cases}
    250 M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.76}
    v_{500}^{3.8}   \eta_{0.02}  & \text{core} \\
    140 \Mbheight^{-0.48}
    v_{500}^{2.4}   \eta_{0.02}  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:tgrow_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
which we have normalized in terms of the Hubble time.

\subsection{Cooling}
\label{sec:cooling}

  \subsection{Angular Momentum}
  \label{sec:ang}
  Our models are spherically symmetric and do not include the effects of
  the gas' angular momentum. However, galaxies will in general have some
  net rotation, and the gas will generally have some non-zero angular
  momentum. At some radius, $\rcirc$, the specific angular momentum of
  the gas will equal the specific angular momentum of a circular
  orbit. Inside of this radius our assumptions of no rotation and
  spherical symmetry will break down. But if $\rcirc$ is inside of the
  inner sonic point of the flow, the region where angular momentum
  becomes important will be causally disconnected from the rest of the
  flow, and we would be justified in neglecting angular momentum (at
  least on large scales).

  $\rcirc$ depends on the gas injection radius. The largest
  injection radius is $\rs$. Let $\lrs$ be the gas specific angular
  momentum at $\rs$, then 

  \begin{align}
    \rcirc=\frac{\lrs}{G \Mbh}
  \end{align}

  \citet{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a} used two-dimensional kinematic
  data to measure the ratio of ordered to random motion in a sample of
  early type galaxies. More precisely, they measure

  \begin{align}
    \lambda_R=\frac{\left<R|V|\right>}{\left<R\sqrt{V^2+\sigma^2}\right>}
  \end{align}

  Where $R$ is the distance is the distance from the galactic center, $V$ is
  the mean stellar velocity, and $\sigma$ is the velocity
  dispersion. The brackets represent a luminosity weighted average.

  We may rewrite the specific angular momentum at $\rs$ in terms of
  $\lambda_R$.

  \begin{align}
    \lrs\simeq\lambdars \sigma(\rs)^2 \rs^2
  \end{align}

  Then

  \begin{align}
    \rcirc&\simeq\lambdars^2 \frac{\sigma(\rs)^2}{G \Mbh} \rs^2\\
    &\simeq\lambdars^2 \frac{\rs^2}{\rsoi} \lsim \lambdars^2 \rsoi
  \end{align}

  The inner sonic point, $\rss$ general occurs at $\simeq 1\%$ of
  $\rsoi$. {\bf AG need to explain this somehow. Also, note in our
    simulations the inner sonic point is not properly resolved.}
  So if $\lambdars\lsim 0.1$, $\rcirc<\rss$. In Fig. 2 of
  \citet{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a} $\lambda_R$ is plotted as function
  of radius for a sample of early type galaxies. On scales of $\sim 0.1
  R_e$ $\lambda_R$ is either less than 0.1 or rapidly declining for most
  of their sample %%need to be clearer on rapidly declining also compare
  %% this scale to the sphere of influence scale.
  This suggests that angular momentum should generally be unimportant.

  \section{Summary}
  \label{sec:summary}
  We have calculated steady-state models for circumnuclear medium of a
  sample of early type galaxies, assuming that gas is supplied
  entirely by stellar wind mass loss and heated by shocked stellar
  winds and SNe Ia. We may use these profiles to calculate an $\Mdot$
  onto each of sample galaxy's SMBH, and get the scaling of $\Mdot$
  with $\Mbh$. We may then compare our results with observed trends of
  nuclear x-ray luminosity. Our main conclusions may be summarized as
  follows.

  \begin{enumerate}
  %Younger population=>higher accretion rate; generally higher eta and
  %lower vw except for very young stellar populations.
  \item We find that $\eddr \propto \Mbh^{\alpha}$, where the value of
    $\alpha$ depends on the slope of the stellar density profile
    ($\alpha\simeq0.5,1$ for cusp and core galaxies respectively). One
    possible solution that the wind mass loss rate (i.e. $\eta$)
    increases with $\Mbh$, as would be expected if low mass SMBH
    preferentially hosted younger stellar populations. Another possible
    explanation is that the effective heating rate of the CNM $v_{\rm w,0}$
    decreases with decreasing SMBH mass. This could again be due to an
    older stellar population, since $v_{\rm w,0} \propto \eta^{−1/2}$
    for heating sources such as SN Ia and millisecond pulsars.
  \item We compare the $\Mdot$ for each of our solution to the one
    calculated from the Bondi formula. We find that they generally to
    a factor of a few. In our model the accretion rate is determined
    from the gas properties at the stagnation radius, $\rs$, which
    agrees with the Bondi radius, $\rb$, within a factor of a
    few. Thus, use of the Bondi formula is a good approximation.
  \item We compare our solutions for density and temperature to those
    inferred from Chandra x-ray observations by \citet{AllenDunn+:2006a}
    and \citet{RussellMcNamara+:2013a} for a handful of galaxies in
    which our sample overlap with theirs. In general, we cannot match
    the observed gas density slope on large scales. 
  \end{enumerate}
