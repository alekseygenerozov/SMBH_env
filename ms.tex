\title{Modeling the Circumnuclear Mediums and Accetion Rates of Quiescent Supermassive Black Holes}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Steady-state one-dimensional hydrodynamic profiles of hot gas in the nuclei of quiescent galaxies are calculated for a range of black hole masses, parameterized gas heating rates, and physically-motivated stellar density profiles.  Mass is supplied to the circumnuclear medium (CNM) by stellar winds, while gas is heated by a combination of stellar winds, supernovae, and black hole feedback.  Analytic estimates are derived, neglecting radiative cooling, for quantities including the stagnation radius where the radial velocity goes to zero (if it exists) and the black hole accretion rate as a function of the heating efficiency, the latter of which is related to the star-formation history of the stellar population.  These results are used to assess over what range of conditions radiative instability will develop, assuming a feedback due to the average star formation history for galaxies of the given black hole mass.  Our main conclusion is that.....  Implications of our results for estimates of the accretion rate using Bondi formula, and for the diversity of CNM environments encountered by the jetted outflows from tidal disruption events, and for the use of an assumed $\dot{M}-M_{\bullet}$ relationship to constrain the occupation fraction of SMBHs in low mass galaxies, are briefly discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%% Maybe active galaxies constitute 10% need reference here?
Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) lurk in the centers of most, if not
all nearby galaxies (see reviews by,
e.g. \citealt{KormendyRichstone:1995a};
\citealt{FerrareseFord:2005a}). However, only a few percent of these
manifest themselves as luminous Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).  Nearly
quiescent SMBHs, such as those hosting low luminosity AGN, constitute
a silent majority (e.g.~\citealt{Ho:2009a}).

To understand why most SMBHs appear to be inactive requires understanding their gaseous environments.  Hot gas near the
SMBH sphere of influence (hereafter the `circumnuclear medium', or CNM) controls the central mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$.  The latter in turn affects the luminosity of the accretion flow and the possible impact of its energy and momentum input (`feedback') on larger scales.  The presence of dense gas in the nucleus can also lead to runaway cooling instabilities, resulting in bursty star-formation or episodic AGN activity (reference Ciotti and others).

Knowledge of how $\dot{M}$ varies with the SMBH mass $\Mbh$ and other properties of the
galactic nucleus informs key questions related to co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies with cosmic time.  SMBH growth in the low redshift universe appears to be dominated by lower mass black holes (e.g.~\citealt{Heckman+04}).  This is often
attributed to cosmological `down sizing' (e.g, \citealt{Gallo+08}), even though the physical processes involved may be distinct from those operating at higher SMBH masses and accretion rates in quasars.

The accretion rates of low mass SMBHs, and their resulting nuclear X-ray luminosities $L_X$, also have implications for observational
constraints on their occupation fraction in low mass galaxies and the
possible existence of intermediate mass black holes.  By combining the average relationship between $\Mbh$ and
$L_X$ measured from a sample of high mass galaxies (\citealt{Gallo+08}) with upper limits on $L_X$ in lower mass
galaxies, \citet{MillerGallo+:2014a}  infer tentative evidence for an occupation fraction less than unity in the latter.  This method, however, relies on extrapolating a power-law fit to the $L_X-\Mbh$ distribution to low $\Mbh$ below the detection threshold.  

%The conclusions of
%\citet{MillerGallo+:2014a} are thus sensitive to possible changes in
%the $L_X$-$\Mbh$ relationship at small $\Mbh$.
% AG: In our model we obtain a steeper relationship, but we have difficulty matching the observed relationship above the detection threshold

The gas density of the CNM also influences the emission from stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs), such as the high energy
transient {\it Swift} J1644+57 (\citealt{Levan+11}; \citealt{Bloom+11}, \citealt{Burrows+11}; \citealt{Zauderer+11}).
This event was powered by a transient relativistic jet, which produced
synchrotron radio emission as the jet material was decelerated by
shock interaction with the CNM of the previously quiescent SMBH
(\citealt{Giannios&Metzger11}; \citealt{Zauderer+11}).  Detailed
modeling of J1644+57 showed that the CNM density was
significantly lower than that measured surrounding Sgr A$^{\star}$
(\citealt{Metzger+12}; \citealt{Berger+12}).  However, a TDE jet
injected into a denser CNM would be decelerated more rapidly,
producing substantially different radio emission than in J1644+57.  Variations in the properties of the CNM could thus in
principle help explain why most TDEs appear to be radio quiet
(e.g.~\citealt{Bower+13}; \citealt{VanVelzen+13}).

Gas comprising the CNM can in principle originate from a variety of sources: (1) wind mass loss from (predominantly evolved) stars; (2) star-star collisions; and (3) unbound debris from TDEs.  Stellar wind mass loss is probably the dominant source insofar as collisions are relevant only in very dense stellar environments for young stellar populations (\citealt{Rubin&Loeb11}), while \citet{MacLeod+13} find that TDEs contribute subdominantly to the time-averaged accretion rate of quiescent SMBHs.

\citet{Ho:2009a} estimates the accretion rates onto a sample of early-type galaxies both by using X-ray observations to determine the Bondi accretion rate and using estimates for the mass loss rate of evolved stars.  Both methods lead to the conclusion that the available gas reservoir is more than sufficient to power the observed low-luminosity AGN, assuming the standard $\sim$ 10 per cent radiative efficiency for thin disk accretion.  Several independent strains of evidence now suggest that low-luminosity AGN result from accretion proceeding in a radiatively inefficient mode (\citealt{Yuan&Narayan14}), due either to the advection of gravitationally-released energy across the SMBH horizon (e.g.~\citealt{Narayan&Yi95}) or due to a low efficiency for the gas inflowing on large scales ultimately reaching the SMBH (e.g.~\citealt{Blandford&Begelman99}; \citealt{Li+13}).

%In fact, the temperature profile is assumed to be flat inside of the
%Bondi radius.  In reality, the cusp in the velocity dispersion near
%the SMBH, should cause a cusp in the gas temperature profile (assuming
%the kinetic energy of stellar winds is efficiently thermalized in
%shocks).
%% AG-give sense of scale.

Another approach to determine the SMBH accretion rate, which we adopt in this paper, is to directly calculate the density, velocity and temperature profiles of the CNM using a physically motivated
hydrodynamic model.  Mass is injected to the nuclear environment via
stellar winds, while energy input results from several sources including stellar winds, supernovae, and AGN feedback (e.g., \citealt{Quataert:2004a,De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  Unlike previous works focusing on modeling individual galaxies, here we systematically analyze the properties of the CNM across a sample of galaxies with a range of SMBH masses, stellar density profiles, and star formation histories (\citealt{WangMerritt:2004a};
hereafter WM04).  

Past studies, including multi-dimensional hydrodynamics and a variety of (parameterized) physical effects, have focused on relatively massive elliptical galaxies (Ciotti refs).  A key result of this work is the periodic development of cooling instabilities, which temporarily increase the gas accretion rate before black hole feedback grows sufficiently important to halt this growth.  Here we instead focus on time-independent models, neglecting radiative cooling.  This simple approach allows us to systematically and to derive simple analytic expressions that prove useful in exploring whether cooling instabilties are always manifest, or whether other forms of non-AGN feedback can result in steady accretion.  Even if cooling instabilties develop on galactic scales, phases of stable accretion may persist on small scales.  We are thus motivated to explore whether it steady-flow is possible under any circumstances, or whether accretion is always building towards instability.

In the presence of strong heating, one-dimensional steady-state flow is characterized by an inflow-outflow structure, with a critical radius known as the``stagnation radius" $\rs$ where the radial velocity passes through zero.  Mass loss from stars interior to the stagnation radius is accreted, while that outside $\rs$ is unbound in an outflow from the nucleus.  The stagnation radius, rather than the Bondi radius, thus controls the SMBH accretion rate, although $\rs$ can in many cases lie within a factor of few of the nominal Bondi radius.  In the case of weak heating, however, no stagnation radius may exist at all, i.e. the entire ISM of the galaxy is feeding the SMBH.  Another goal of this work is to assess under what conditions a stagnation radius exists, as this question is intimately tied to the one of cooling instability.  
% Furthermore, in some cases we find that no stagnation
% radius exists at all; this formally implies that the entire of ISM of
% the galaxy is feeding the SMBH, potentially resulting in much higher
% accretion rate than would be predicted by simple Bondi accretion. 
The main goal of our analysis is to provide a framework for
interpreting the properties of quiescent galactic nuclei given the
comparatively well understood physics of stellar winds and supernova
heating.

This paper is organized as followed.  In $\S\ref{sec:model}$ we
describe our model, including the sample of galaxies used in our
analysis ($\S\ref{sec:sample}$) and our numerical procedure for
calculating the steady-state hydrodynamic profile of the CNM
($\S\ref{sec:hydro}$).  In $\S\ref{sec:results}$ we describe our
results.  In $\S\ref{sec:applications}$ we describe applicaiton of our
results, including a comparison of our gas profiles to those inferred
from {\it Chandra} observations and to the measured $L_X-\Mbh$
relationship.  In $\S\ref{sec:discussion}$ we discuss our results.  In
$\S\ref{sec:summary}$ we summarize our results.
\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}
\subsection{Galaxy models}
\citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} use Hubble WFPC2 imaging to measure the
radial surface brightness profiles for hundreds of nearby early type galaxies. The measured surface brightness profile is generally well-fit by a ``Nuker" law parameterization:
\begin{equation}
  I(\xi)=I_b 2^{(\beta-\Gamma)/\alpha} \xi^{-\Gamma} (1+\xi^\alpha)^{-(\beta-\Gamma)/\alpha}, \,\,\,\xi\equiv\frac{r}{r_b}.
\end{equation}
The Nuker profile is a broken power law which transitions from an inner power law slope, $\Gamma$, to an outer power law slope, $\beta$, at a break radius, $\rb$.  Assuming spherical symmetry, this corresponds to a stellar density $\rhostar \sim r^{-1-\Gamma}$ for $r \ll \rb$ and $\rhostar\sim r^{-1-\beta}$ for $r \gg \rb$, thus motivating us to adopt a broken power-law profile
\begin{align}
\rho_\star = 
\begin{cases}
\rho_\star(\rsoi) \left(r/\rsoi\right)^{-1-\Gamma} & r \leq r_b\\
\rho_\star(r_b) \left(r/r_b\right)^{-1-\beta} & r > r_b,
\label{eq:rhostar}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\rho_\star(\rsoi)$ is the stellar density at the radius of the black hole sphere of influence, 
\be
\rsoi \simeq G \Mbh/\sigma^2 \approx 14 M_{\bullet,8}^{0.6}\,{\rm pc},
\label{eq:rsoi}
\ee
and the final equality in (\ref{eq:rsoi}) employs a recent version of the $\Mbh-\sigma$ relationship (\citealt{Gultekin+09}),
 \begin{align}
M_{\bullet} \simeq 2\times 10^{8}\left(\frac{\sigma}{200\,{\rm
      km\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{5.1}M_{\odot}.
\label{eq:Msigma}
\end{align}
Although the use of equation (\ref{eq:Msigma}) is questionable for low mass black holes (e.g., \citealt{Greene&Ho07}), our results are not overly sensitive to this assumption.  

A galaxy model is fully specified by four parameters: $\Mbh$, $\Gamma$, $r_b$,
and $\beta$.  We compute models for three different black hole masses, $\Mbh = 10^6$, $10^7$, $10^8 \Msun$.  The distribution of $\Gamma$ in the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} sample is bimodal, with a concentration of ``core" galaxies with $\Gamma \lsim 0.3$ and a concentration of ``cusp" galaxies with $\Gamma \gsim 0.7$.  We bracket these possibilities by considering models with $\Gamma=0.8$ and $\Gamma=0.1$.  Since we are generally interested in properties of the gas flow on radial scales $\ll r_b$, we fix $\beta = 2$ (a typical value), an assumption to which most of our results is not sensitive.  However, the presence of $\rb$ is necessary for to obtain a converged steady state for some regions of our parameter space. We adopt $\rb=100$ pc for cusp galaxies ($\Gamma=0.8$), while for core galaxy models we employ the scaling relation $\rb = $, motivated again by the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} sample. ({\bf BDM: fill in!}).  Though simplistic, our results are not sensitive to our assumption about the value of $\rb$.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic Equations}
\label{sec:hydro}

Following \citet{Quataert:2004a} (see also \citealt{HolzerAxford:1970a,De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}), we calculate the gas density profile $\rho$ of the CNM for each galaxy model by solving the equations of one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) time-dependent hydrodynamics,
\begin{align}
  &\drhodt+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r^2 v\right)=q \label{eq:drhodt}\\
  &\rho \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial
      v}{\partial r}\right) =-\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}- \rho\frac{GM_{\rm enc}}{r^{2}} -q v \label{eq:dvdt}\\
  &\rho T\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial
      s}{\partial r}\right)=q\left[\ke+\kew-\gammaf \cs \right] +\nabla\cdot(\kappa \nabla T)
, 
\label{eq:dsdt}
\end{align}
where $v$, $T$, $p$ and $s$ are the radial velocity, temperature,
pressure and specific entropy of the gas, respectively, and $M_{\rm enc} = M_{\star}(r) + \Mbh$ is the
enclosed mass.  We assume an ideal gas equation of state with $p =
\rho kT/\mu m_p$ with $\mu = 0.62$  and $\gamma = 5/3$. {\bf BDM: take $\mu = 0.62$ here for fully ionized gas - what did you do?}

The source term in the continuity equation (eq.~[\ref{eq:drhodt}]),
\begin{align}
  q=\frac{\eta \rhostar}{\th},
\label{eq:q}
\end{align}
represents mass input from stellar winds, which we parameterize in
terms of the fraction $\eta$ of the stellar density $\rhostar$ being
recycled into gas on the Hubble time $\th = 1.4 \times 10^{10}$
years.  To good approximation $\eta\simeq 0.02 (t_{\star}/t_h)^{-1.3}$ at time $t_{\star}$ following a burst of star formation (e.g., \citealt{Ciotti+91}),\footnote{\citet{Ciotti+91} give the overall mass return rate from evolved stars as a function of B-band luminosity.  Although we give the mass return rate per unit volume, our expressions are equivalent.} although $\eta$ is higher in cases of ongoing star formation.  

Source terms $\propto q$ also appear in the momentum and entropy equations (eqs.~[\ref{eq:dvdt}] and [\ref{eq:dsdt}]) because isotropic mass injection in the SMBH rest frame represents a source of momentum and energy relative to the mean flow.  Physically, these result from the mismatch between the properties of virialized gas injected locally by stellar winds and the mean properties of the background flow.   The term $\propto -q c_{s}^{2}$ turns out to be an important in stabilizing the flow to runaway cooling ($\S$).

The last term in equation (\ref{eq:dsdt}) accounts for heat transportation by electron conductivity, where $\kappa_{\rm eff}=\kappa_{\rm spitz}/(1+\psi)$ (\citealt{DaltonBalbus:1993a}) is the conducitivity and $\kappa_{\rm spitz} = \kappa_0 T^{5/2}$ is the classical \citet{Spitzer62} value ($\kappa_0\simeq 2\times 10^{-6}$ in cgs units).  The flux limitor $\psi = \kappa_{\rm spitz} \nabla T/(5\phi \rho c_s^3)$ saturates the conductive flux if the mean free path for electron coulomb scattering becomes comparable to the temperature length scale, where $c_s \equiv (kT/\mu m_p)^{1/2}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $\phi \lesssim 1$ is an uncertain dimensionless constant (we adopt $\phi = 0.1$).  Even a weak magnetic field perpendicular to the flow could in principle suppress the conductivity.  However, the radially-decreasing temperature profiles of interest are susceptible to the magneto-thermal instability (\citealt{Balbus01}), the non-linear evolution of which is believed to result in a radially-directed field structure (\citealt{Parrish&Stone07}).

The term $\propto \vw^2 = \sigma(r)^2+v_{w,0}^2$ in the entropy equation accounts for external heating sources (e.g., \citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  The first term accounts for the minimum shock heating of the stellar winds due to the random movement of stars with respect to each other at the characteristic velocity $\sim \sigma = \sqrt{GM_{\rm enc}/r}$, as is present even for the low wind velocities $\ll \sigma$ that characterize AGB mass loss in old stellar populations.  The second term, $v_{w,0}^{2}$, parameterizes the contribution of additional sources of heating, such as faster main sequence or Wolf-Rayet winds, millisecond pulsars, supernovae, AGN feedback, etc.  As discussed in $\S\ref{sec:heating}$, the value of $v_{w,0}$ is uncertain and will in general depend on the SMBH mass and the age of the stellar population.

Equations (\ref{eq:drhodt})-(\ref{eq:dsdt}) are solved using a sixth
order finite difference scheme with a third order Runge-Kutta scheme
for time integration and artificial viscosity terms in the velocity
and entropy equations for numerical stability (\citealt{Brandenburg:2003a}).  We solve the equations for different choices of $v_{\rm w,0} = 300, 600, 1200$ km s$^{-1}$ spanning a physically plausible
range.  Although we are interested in the steady-state intflow/outflow structure, the time-dependent equations are solved to avoid numerical issues that arise near the critical sonic points, of which there are up to two because of the supersonic inflow on small radial scales and a possible supersonic outflow on large scales.

Radiative cooling is not included in our calculation.  Across much of the parameter space radiative cooling is subdominant compared to other sources of cooling.  Radiative cooling cannot be neglected when $\vwO$ is low (and/or $\eta$ is high), but once important it leads to thermal instabilities (e.g.~\citealt{McCourt+12}) which our 1D time-independent model cannot account for self-consistently anyways.  Indeed, one of the main goals of this work is to use our analytic and numerical solutions neglecting radiation to ascertain over what physical conditions cooling instabilities are likely to develop ($\S\ref{sec:cooling}$).

The accuracy of our numerical solutions is assessed by checking the level of conservation of mass across the grid, as well as the integral constraint on the energy.  Mass and energy are conserved to $\lesssim
40$ per cent for all solutions presented in this paper. 
{\bf BDM: more details...}


\section{Results}

We begin by describing useful analytic results before presenting our numerical solutions.  

\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Analytic Results}

Here we summarize analytic estimates of physical quantities, such as the stagnation radius $\rs$ and the mass accretion rate, the detailed derivation of which are given in Appendix \ref{app:rs}.  Our results are expressed in terms of the SMBH mass $M_{\bullet} = 10^{8}M_{\bullet,8}M_{\odot}$ and the wind heating parameter (eq.~[\ref{eq:dsdt}])
\begin{eqnarray}
v_{\rm w} &=& v_{\rm w,0}\left(1+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{v_{\rm w,0}^{2}}\right)^{1/2}  \nonumber \\
 &\approx& v_{\rm w,0}\left(1+0.14 \Mbheight^{0.43}\left[\frac{v_{w,0}}{500\,\rm km\,s^{-1}}\right]^{-1}\right)^{1/2},
\end{eqnarray}
where we remind that the parameter $\vwO$ accounts for wind heating beyond the baseline level produced by the winds of old stars, and the final equality makes use of $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:Msigma}]).

\subsubsection{Flow Properties Near the Stagnation Radius}

Continuity of the entropy derivative at the stagnation radius demands that the temperature at the stagnation radius is given by (Appendix \ref{app:rs}, eq.~[\ref{eq:first_law}])
\begin{align}
T \simeq \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\frac{\mu m_p v_{w}^{2}}{2} \approx 3.7
\times 10^6\ \, v_{500}^2 \,\,{\rm K} 
\label{eq:Tanalytic}
\end{align}

Hydrostatic equilibrium can be used to determine the location of the stagnation radius where $v = 0$ (Appendix \ref{app:rs}, eq.~\ref{eq:rs2main})
\begin{align}
\rs=\frac{G \Mbh}{n \vw(\rs)^2}\left(\frac{9-\Gamma}{2} \frac{\Mstar(\rs)}{\Mbh} +\frac{7}{2}\right),
\label{eq:stag_analytic})
\end{align}
in terms of the radius of the sphere of influence (eq.~[\ref{eq:rsoi}]), where $n$ is the power-law slope of the density profile at $r = r_{\rm s}$.

If the SMBH dominates the gravitational potential at the stagnation radius ($M_{\bullet} \gg M_{\star}$; $v_{w,0} \gg \sigma$) then equation (\ref{eq:stag_analytic}) simplifies greatly
\begin{align}
  &\rs=\frac{7}{2}\frac{G \Mbh}{n v_{\rm w}^{2}} \approx 6
 \, \pc \,\, \Mbheight v_{500}^{-2},
  \label{eq:stag_simple}
\end{align}
where the numerical estimate assumes $n = 1$.  This expression is similar to that obtained by \citet{Volonteri+11} on heuristic grounds (their equation~[6]).  In the opposite limit when the wind heating is weaker ($v_{\rm w,0} \ll \sigma$), the stagnation radius moves to very large radii or may not exist at all.  

\subsubsection{SMBH Accretion Rate}

The SMBH accretion rate is given by the integrated mass loss rate interior to the stagnation radius (eq.~[\ref{eq:q}]), 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dot{M} &=& \frac{\eta \Menc(\rs)}{\th} \nonumber \\
&\approx&
  \begin{cases}
    2.9 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{1.76}
    v_{500}^{-3.8}  \eta_{0.02} \Msun \, \pyear& \text{core} \\
    5.3 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{1.48} 
    v_{500}^{-2.4}  \eta_{0.02} \Msun \, \pyear  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:mdot_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have made use of equation (\ref{eq:stag_simple}), i.e. assuming that $v_{w,0} \gg \sigma$.  The resulting Eddington ratio $\eddr$ is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\dot{M}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} &\approx&
  \begin{cases}
    1.3 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.76}
    v_{500}^{-3.8}  \eta_{0.02}   & \text{core} \\
    2.4 \times 10^{-5} \Mbheight^{0.48} 
    v_{500}^{-2.4}  \eta_{0.02}   & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:eddr_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
To reproduce the estimated values $\sim 10^{-XX}$ in low luminosity AGN, we thus require $v_{w,0} \sim $.  {\bf BDM: put some realistic numbers, e.g. from Ho 2009 or better references}

The gas density at the stagnation radius $\rho(r_{\rm s})$ is more challenging to estimate.  Its value can be crudely estimated using equation (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}) in conjunction with an alternative estimate of $\dot{M}$ as the gaseous mass within the stagnation radius divided by the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff}(\rs) = (r_{\rm s}^{3}/GM_{\bullet})^{1/2}$, viz.
\begin{align}
  &\dot{M}\sim\frac{(4 \pi/3) \rs^3 \rho(\rs)}{\tff(\rs)},
  \label{eq:mdot_gas}
\end{align}
from which one derives 
\begin{align}
  \rho(\rs)\approx
  \begin{cases}
    5 \times 10^{-26} \Mbheight^{-0.2} v_{500}^{-0.8}  \eta_{0.02} \,
    \, {\rm g \, cm^{-3}}& \text{core},\\
    9 \times 10^{-26}  \Mbheight^{-0.5} v_{500}^{0.6}  \eta_{0.02} \,\, {\rm g \,cm^{-3}} & \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rhors}
\end{align}
again using equation (\ref{eq:rs_simple}) for the stagnation radius.  

%Note that by combining equations~\eqref{eq:mdot_analytic}
%and~\eqref{eq:mdot_gas}, one can also write
%\begin{align}
%\rho(\rs)=\frac{3 q(\rs) \tff(\rs)}{2-\Gamma}.
%\label{eq:rhors2}
%\end{align}

It is useful to compare our expression for the mass accretion rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]) to the traditional ``Bondi" rate for accretion onto a point source from an external medium of fixed density and temperature density (\citealt{Bondi52}):
\begin{align}
  \dot{M}_{\rm B} =4\pi \lambda r_b^2 \rho(r_b) v_{\rm ff}(r_b),
\label{eq:bondi}
\end{align}
where $r_b \equiv GM/c_{s}^{2}$ is the Bondi radius, $v_{\rm ff} = (GM_{\bullet}/r)^{1/2}$ and $\lambda$ is a parameter of order unity.  Rewriting equation (\ref{eq:mdot_gas}) as $\dot{M}\simeq 4\pi \rs^2 \rho(\rs) v_{\rm ff}(\rs)/3$,
we note a similarity between equation (\ref{eq:mdot_gas}) and the Bondi formula (eq.~[\ref{eq:bondi}]) if $\rb$ is replaced by $\rs$.  When the stagnation radius resides interior to the sphere of influence we indeed have (eq.~[\ref{eq:stag_simple}])
\begin{align}
  \rs\approx\frac{7}{2}\frac{G \Mbh}{\vwO^2} \approx \frac{14}{3}\frac{GM_{\bullet}}{c_{s}^{2}} = \frac{14}{3}r_{\rm B},
  \label{eq:rs_simple}
\end{align}
where the second equality makes use of equation (\ref{eq:Tanalytic}). 

\subsubsection{Importance of Heat Conduction}

The above analytic results neglect the effects of heat conduction near the stagnation radius, an assumption we now check.  The importance of conductive heating can be estimated by comparing its magnitude to the nominal level of ``wind" heating:
\begin{align}
  \left.\frac{\nabla\cdot(\kappa \nabla T)}{q v_{\rm
w}^{2}/2}\right|_{r_{\rm s}} &\sim \frac{2t_{\rm h}\kappa_0
T^{7/2}}{r_{\rm s}^{2}\eta \rho_{\star}(r_{\rm s}) v_{\rm w}^{2}(1+\phi)}
\nonumber \\ &\sim {\rm min}
  \begin{cases}
  10 \eta_{0.02}^{-1}
M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.8} v_{500}^{6.8} &  \text{unsaturated (core)}\\
 10 \eta_{0.02}^{-1}
M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.5} v_{500}^{5.4} &  \text{unsaturated (cusp)}\\
  10 \phi/(2-\Gamma) & \text{saturated},
  \end{cases}
 \label{eq:rhors}
\end{align}
where the second equality makes use of equations (\ref{eq:Tanalytic}), (\ref{eq:stag_simple}), and we have approximated $\nabla^{2} \sim 1/r_{\rm st}^{2}$, $\nabla \sim 1/r_{\rm st}$.  Because the stagnation radius is usually well inside the break radius, we have approximated the stellar density as (eq.~[\ref{eq:rhostar}])
\begin{eqnarray}
  \rho_{\star}(r_{\rm s}) &\simeq& \frac{M_{\bullet}(2-\Gamma)}{4\pi r_{\rm soi}^{3}}\left(\frac{r_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm soi}}\right)^{-1-\Gamma} \nonumber \\
 &\approx& \begin{cases}
    9.4 \times 10^{-19}M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.2}v_{500}^{2.2}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}
    & \text{core} \\
    1.1 \times 10^{-18} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.5}v_{500}^{3.6}
    \,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rhostarrs}
\end{eqnarray}
Even in the saturated case, heat conduction is at most an order unity correction for expected values of the saturation parameter $\phi < 0.3$, justifying its neglect in our analysis.  

\subsubsection{Thermal Instability}

Radiative cooling, if important, qualitative alters key features of the accretion flow.  Initially hydrostatic gas that cools at constant pressure $P \propto nT$ at the rate $\dot{q}_{\rm cool} \propto T^{-2.7}$ (see below) is thermally unstable.  If manifest, thermal instability leads to initially higher black hole accretion rates and enhanced star formation which, when coupled to the flow by feed-back processes, can lead to limit cycle behavior inconsistent with our assumption of steady flow (e.g.~\citealt{Wang+14}).  

Radiative cooling can, however, be stabilized by the other sources of cooling, such as the stellar wind source term $\propto -q c_{s}^{2} \propto -qT$ in the entropy equation (eq.~[\ref{eq:dsdt}]), which at the stagnation radius equals $q v_{\rm w}^{2}/2$ (neglecting conduction and radiative cooling).  Thermal stability at the stagnation radius can thus be assessed by comparing the nominal wind heating rate to the rate of radiative cooling $|\dot{q}_{\rm cool}| =|\Lambda(T) n^2|$,
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{q \vw^2/2}{|\dot{q}_{\rm cool}|}\right|_{\rm r{s}} \simeq
  \begin{cases}
   590 \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.76}v_{500}^{7.2}  &, \text{core}\\
   210 \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.48}v_{500}^{5.8}  &, \text{cusp},     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling2}
\end{align}
where we have used equations (\ref{eq:rhors}) and (\ref{eq:rhostarrs}) for the gaseous and stellar densities at the stagnation radius, respectively.  Here $n = \rho/\mu m_p$ and we have approximated the cooling function for $T < 2\times 10^{7}$ K as $\Lambda(T) = 1.1 \times 10^{-22} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{-0.7}  $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}$ assuming solar metallicity gas (\citealt{Draine:2011a}, Fig. 34.1).  To within a constant of order unity, equation (\ref{eq:cooling2}) also equals the ratio of the gas cooling timescale $t_{\rm cool} \equiv (3\rho kT/2\mu m_p)/\dot{q}_{\rm cool}$ to the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff}$ if one uses the equality 
\begin{align}
\rho(\rs)=\frac{3 q(\rs) \tff(\rs)}{2-\Gamma}.
\label{eq:rhors2}
\end{align}
that results by combining equations~\eqref{eq:mdot_analytic} and~\eqref{eq:mdot_gas}.

Thermal stability ($0.5 q \vw^2/|\dot{q}_{\rm cool}| > 1$; $t_{\rm cool} > t_{\rm ff}$) at the stagnation radius thus requires a critical minimum heating rate
\begin{align}
v_{w,0} > v_{\rm crit} \simeq
  {\rm max}\begin{cases}
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.14} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.11}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}  &, \text{core}\\
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.17} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.08}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}   &, \text{cusp}\\
\sigma,     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling2}
\end{align}
Our numerical results in $\S\ref{sec:numerical}$ demonstrate that $v_{w} \gtrsim v_{\rm crit} \sim 200-300$ km s$^{-1}$ is generally a condition for stability at all radii, not just at the stagnation radius.  The inclusion of $\sigma$ in equation (\ref{eq:cooling2}) results because the top two lines apply only for $v_{w} > \sigma$ since their derivation assumed the existence of a stagnation radius given by equation (\ref{eq:rs_simple}).



% For each of our galaxies Table \ref{tab:eta} provides the maximum value of $\eta$ such that $H/C >$1 at all radii.  Roughly speaking, this is the maximum $\eta$ for which it would be safe to ignore cooling.  If cooling is important, the CNM is likely to be thermally unstable, resulting in the formation of a cold medium that could substantially enhance the rate of accretion onto the SMBH.  

%\begin{align}
 % \Lambda(T)\simeq
  %\begin{cases}
   % 2.3 \times 10^{-24} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{0.5} $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}& \text{if } T \gsim 2 \times 10^7 \text{K} \\
   % 1.1 \times 10^{-22} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{-0.7}  $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}& \text{if } T \lsim 2 \times 10^7 \text{K}     
  %\end{cases}
  %\label{eq:cooling}
%\end{align}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{cooling.eps}
  \caption{\label{fig:cooling} Ratio of heating ($H$) to cooling rate
    ($C$) for each of our solutions (solid lines). The cooling rate is
    calculated using the approximate (solar metallicity) cooling

    estimated as $q \vw^2/2+q v^2/2$. The ratio is computed from
    equation (\ref{eq:cooling}) assuming a stellar mass loss rate

    and a solution should be stable as long as
    $H/C\gsim1$. $\tcool/\tff$ is a diagnostic for local thermal
    instability, solutions should be stable as long as $\tcool/t_{\rm

    the two ratios coincide at $\rs$ (marked with a square for each

This section describes the results of our numerical calculations,
which we use to assess the validity of the analytic expressions
provided in the previous section.  Numerical solutions are calculated
for each galaxy for three different values of the stellar wind heating
parameter $v_{w,0}$ = 300, 600, 1200 km s$^{-1}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:profiles} shows profiles of the density $\rho(r)$,
temperature $T(r)$, and radial velocity $|v(r)|$, for the cusp
($\Gamma=0.8$) solutions within our grid.  As expected, the gas
density increases towards the SMBH $\rho\propto r^{-n}$ with
$n\simeq1$.  Note that this is shallower than the $-3/2$ power law for
Bondi accretion. However, the power law behavior does not extend
through all radii, and the gas density profile has a break coincident
with the location of the break in the stellar light profile ($\rb=100$
pc). The temperature profile is relatively flat at large radii, but
increases as $\propto 1/r^{k}$ interior to the sphere of influence,
where $k$ is smaller than 1--the power expected for virialized gas.
The inwardly directed velocity increases towards the hole approaching
The inwardly directed velocity is steeper than what would be expected
for the free-fall velocity $v \propto v_{\rm ff}\propto r^{-1/2}$.
% {\bf BDM: I made this up - in general we need
%   more explanation of what the plots are actually showing, with some
%   physical explanation.}
% AG -- things are not quite approaching Bondi on the inner grid. I
% don't have a good physical explanation yet...


Figure~\ref{fig:stag} (top panel) shows numerical results for the
stagnation radius $r_{\rm s}$ where the radial velocity goes to zero
(expressed in ratio to the radius of the SMBH sphere of influence
$r_{\rm soi}$), with different colors representing different values of
$v_{w,0}$.  Cusp and core galaxies are marked with square and
triangles, respectively.

We also show the simplified analytic result corresponding to $\rs$
approximated from \eqref{eq:stag_simple} as a solid black line. For
$\vwO$, we find good agreement with the analytic prediction. However,
\eqref{eq:stag_simple} is only valid that $\Mstar(\rs) \ll \Mbh$, and
this approximation breaks down for small $\vwO$. In fact, $\rs$
diverges for smaller $\vwO$. 

{\bf AG perhaps it would be better to solve the implicit equation for
  rs/rsoi, and plot this in the top panel--assuming a fixed n of say
  1}. We may also compare our numerical results $r_{\rm s}/r_{\rm
  soi}$ an be compared directly to our analytic estimate in equation
\ref{eq:stag_analytic}.  The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:stag}
shows the fractional difference between our numerical and analytic
results for $r_{\rm s}/r_{\rm soi}$.  The good agreement provides a
useful check of the numerical results.

Fig.~\ref{fig:cooling} shows $H/C=(q \vw^2+q v^2)/2$ and $\tcool/\tff$
as a function of radius for all of our solutions. {\bf BDM: change
  plots}, with different colors denoting different values of $\vwO$.
For our highest heating rates we observe that cooling is unimportant
for all solutions across all radii--neither the local nor the global
thermal instability would be present. However,  for our smallest value
of $\vwO$=300 km s$^{-1}$ with $\Mbh=10^8 \Msun$, the solution would be
thermally unstable as $H/C<1$ and $\tcool/\tff<10$. Note that the
precise region of the parameter space which would be thermally
unstable would depend on the value of $\eta$--in
Fig.~\pageref{fig:cooling} we have chosen $\eta=0.02$, which would be
appropriate for a stellar population with $\tage\simeq \th$. This
value is on the low end of what we would physically expect for
$\eta$. 

For $\vwO=1200$ km s$^{-1}$ and $\vwO=600$ km s$^{-1}$, we have
$H/C\simeq\tcool/\tff$ at $\rs$ as expected. However, the two ratios
diverge away from $\rs$, as equation~\eqref{eq:rhors2} is not a good
approximation away from $\rs$. Similarly, it is poorer approximation
for $\vwO=300$ km s$^{-1}$. Hence, $H/C$ and $\tcool/\tff$ do not
closely match at $\rs$ for this $\vwO$. {\bf AG would be good to
  clarify the physics here a little more.}

\section{Sources of Heating}
\label{sec:heating}

Key properties of the flow, such as the stagnation radius, the SMBH accretion rate, and the likelihood of thermal instability depend sensitively on the assumed heating rate $\propto qv_{w,0}^{2}$.  This section summarizes individual heating sources, providing estimates of the value of
\begin{align}
  v_{\rm w,0} = \sqrt{\frac{2 t_h e}{\eta \rhostar}}
  \label{eq:vw_eff}
\end{align}
for each, where $e$ is volumetric heating rate.  

\subsection{Stellar winds} 
{\bf AG: This section may have to be substantially modified in light
  of our more careful analysis of stellar winds.}

Although most of the mass supplied to the CNM by stellar winds occurs
during the giant AGB phase, these winds represent a negligible heating
source compared to the random wind velocity because the wind velocity
$\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ is much less than the stellar potential
$\sigma$.

Main sequence winds, though contributing a much smaller quantity of
mass, have much higher velocities and hence contribute a
disproportionally large share of the kinetic energy of winds.
\citet{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a} estimate that $v_{\rm w,0} \sim
100-150$ km s$^{-1}$ for main sequence winds assuming a relatively old
stellar population.  On the other hand, for a very young stellar
population of age $t_{\star} \lesssim 10^{7}$ yrs the effective wind
heating from massive stars can be much greater, $\gtrsim 10^{3}$ km
s$^{-1}$.  In what follows below, we take an effective stellar wind
heating rate \be v_{\rm w,0}^{\star} = 150\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}} \ee In
Appendix \ref{app:windheat} we present a toy model for how $v_{\rm
  w,0}$ varies as a function of stellar age ({\bf BDM: Nick can
  create}).

\subsection{Millisecond Pulsars} Energy injection from millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a potentially important heating source.  If the number of MSPs per unit stellar mass is $n_{\rm msp}$ and each contributes on average a spin-down luminosity $\bar{L}_{\rm sd}$, then the resulting heating per unit volume $e \approx \bar{L}_{\rm sd}n_{\rm
  msp}\epsilon$ results in an effective heating rate (eq.~ [\ref{eq:vw_eff}])
\begin{eqnarray}
  v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm MSP} \approx 30\left(\frac{\epsilon}{0.1}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{\bar{L}_{\rm
        sd}}{10^{34}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{1/2}
  \eta_{0.02}^{-1/2}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}},
  \end{eqnarray}
where $\epsilon$ is the thermalization efficiency of the wind, normalized to a value $\epsilon \lesssim 0.1$ inferred based on modeling the insterstellar mediums of globular clusters \citep{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a}.  The above estimate adopts a pulsar density $n_{\rm msp}\simeq3 \times 10^{-40} $ MSPs g$^{-1}$ motivated by the $\sim 30,000$ estimated MSPs in the Milky Way of stellar mass $6\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ (\citealt{Lorimer13}).  

The average spin-down luminosity of millisecond pulsars in the field is estimated to be $\bar{L}_{\rm sd} \sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ based on the ATNF radio pulsar catalog (\citealt{Manchester+05}), in which case $v_{\rm w,0} \lesssim 30$ km s$^{-1}$.  For higher spin-down luminosities, $L_{\rm sd}\simeq 10^{35}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ characteristic of some Fermi-detected pulsars, then the higher value of $v_{\rm w,0} \lesssim 300$ km s$^{-1}$ makes MSP heating in principle important under the optimistc assumption $\epsilon = 1$.  On the other hand, the binaries giving rise to MSPs may be disocciated by stellar interactions in the dense nuclear cluster, reducing their numbers as compared to the field population estimate above.  We conclude that MSPs are unlikely to be an important source of heating, probably insufficient to stabilize the steady flow against cooling instability (e.g. $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm MSP} < v_{\rm critt}$; eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling2}])  

\subsection{Type Ia Supernovae} 

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) represent a potentially important source of heating, which unlike core collapse SNe is present even in an evolved stellar population.  If each Ia supernova injects thermal energy $E_{\rm Ia}$ into the interstellar medium, and the SNe rate (per stellar mass) is given by $R_{\rm   Ia}$, then the resulting volumetric heating rate $E_{\rm Ia}R_{\rm  Ia}$ produces an effective wind heating parameter (equation~[\ref{eq:vw_eff}]) \begin{align} v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} =\sqrt{\frac{2 t_h R_{\rm Ia}
E_{\rm Ia}}{\eta}} \label{eq:vw_sne}.
\end{align} The thermal energy injected by a Ia SN $E_{\rm Ia} \simeq
\epsilon_{\rm Ia} 10^{51}$ ergs depends on the efficiency $\epsilon$
with which the initial blast wave energy is converted into bulk or turbulent
motion instead of being lost to radiation.  \cite{Thornton+98}
estimate a radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm Ia} \sim 0.1$,
depending weakly on surrounding density, but \citet{Sharma+14} argues
that $\epsilon_{\rm Ia}$ can be considerably higher, $\sim 0.4$, if
the SNe occur in a hot dilute medium, as may characterize the circumnuclear medium.

The Ia SN rate $\RateIa$ depends on the age of the stellar population, as it represent the convolution of the star formation rate and the Ia delay time distribution (DTD) divided by the present stellar mass.  In
the limit of impulsive star formation, $\RateIa$ is the DTD evaluated at the time since the star formation episode.  The observationally inferred DTD (Fig. 1 of \citealt{MaozMannucci+:2012a}) has the
approximate functional form \begin{align}
  R_{\rm Ia} =1.7\times 10^{-14}\left(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm
      h}\right)^{-1.12} M_{\odot}^{-1}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}
\label{eq:DTD}
  \end{align}
  where $\tau_{\star}$ is the time since star formation
  (c.f.~\citealt{Scannapieco&Bildsten05}). 

From equations (\ref{eq:vw_sne}), (\ref{eq:DTD}) we thus estimate that 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
    v_{w,0}^{\rm Ia} &\approx& 700(\epsilon_{\rm
      Ia}/0.4)^{0.5}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.56}\eta_{0.02}^{-1/2}\,{\rm km
      \,s^{-1}} \nonumber \\
&\approx& 700(\epsilon_{\rm
      Ia}/0.4)^{0.5}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.09}\,{\rm km
      \,s^{-1}},
\label{eq:vIa}
  \end{eqnarray}
where the second line assumes $\eta\simeq 0.02 (\tau_{\star}/t_h)^{-1.3}$ for a single burst of star formation (\citealt{Ciotti+91}).

The high value of $v_{w,0}^{\rm Ia}$ implies that Ia SNe represent a potentially dominant source of non-AGN heating in the CNM.  However, SNe can only be approximated as being a constant heating source throughout space and time if the rate of SNe is rapid compared to the inflow time at the radius of interest (\citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  We define the ``Ia radius"
  \begin{align}
    r_{\rm Ia} \sim \left(\frac{G}{R_{\rm Ia}\sigma}\right)^{1/2} \sim
    38 M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.56}\,{\rm pc}
    \label{eq:rIa}
  \end{align}
as the location exterior of which the time interval between subsequent supernovae $\tau_{\rm Ia} \sim 1/M_{\rm enc}R_{\rm Ia} \sim G/r\sigma^{2}R_{\rm Ia}$ exceeds the local dynamical timescale $t_{\rm
dyn} \sim r/\sigma$, where we again adopt the Ia rate for an old stellar population and in the final equality we estimate the velocity dispersion using the $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ relationship
(equation~[\ref{eq:Msigma}]).  

Assuming that $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} \gg \sigma$ then by substituting $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia}$ (eq.~\ref{eq:vIa}) into our expression for the stagnation radius (\ref{eq:rs_simple}), we can write
\begin{eqnarray}
\left.\frac{r_{\rm Ia}}{r_{\rm s}}\right|_{\rm v_{w,0}^{\rm Ia}} &\approx& 12.4\eta_{0.02} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm Ia}/0.4)^{-1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{1.68} \nonumber \\
&\approx& 12.4M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm Ia}/0.4)^{-1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.38}
\end{eqnarray}
The fact that $r_{\rm Ia} \gg r_{\rm s}$ would appear to imply that Ia heating only represents a sources of steady heating near the stagnation radius for very massive SMBHs $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^9 \Msun$ and/or very young populations ($\tau_{\star} \ll t_{\rm h}$).  However, this expression underestimates the importance of Ia heating, since the actual stagnation radius will be substantially larger than its value for $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia}$ if the nominal heating rate is much less than this.  In general it is reasonable to expect that the impact of Ia SN will increase for larger SMBH masses.

What is the effect of the Ia radius?  Between subsequent supernovae, stars release a gaseous mass $M_{\rm g} \approx \eta M_{\star}\tau_{\rm Ia}/t_{\rm h}$ interior to the Ia radius, which is gravitationally bound to the SMBH by an energy $E_{\rm bind} \approx M_{\rm g}\sigma^{2}$.  Thus, according to the above definitions, $E_{\rm Ia}/E_{\rm bind} \sim (v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia})^{2}/2\sigma^{2} \gtrsim 1$.  Hence Ia SN can in principle periodically clear out gas from radii $\sim r_{\rm Ia} \gtrsim r_{\rm s}$. 

\subsection{SMBH Feedback}

Feedback from accretion onto the SMBH represents an important source of heating which is, however, the most difficult to quantify.  A key difference between AGN heating and other sources discussed thus far is its likely dependence on the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$, which is itself a function of the heating rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]).  

There are two types of SMBH feedback: kinetic and radiative.  Radiative feedback is potentially effective even in low luminosity AGN via Compton heating (e.g.,~\citealt{Gan+14}), which provides a volumetric heating rate (\citealt{Gan+14})
\be
\dot{e}_{\rm C} = 4.1\times 10^{-35}n^{2}\xi T_{\rm C}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}},
\ee
where $\xi = L/n r^{2}$ is the ionization parameter and $L$ is the SMBH luminosity with Compton temperature $T_{\rm C} \sim 10^{9}$ K $\gg T$.  


{\bf AG: Note that I obtain Compton heating which is a factor of 2
  higher--although power law dependences look right to me. Note that
  the Compton heating will depend on radius--I use rs in my own
  estimate. }
We estimate the importance of Compton heating by assuming the SMBH
radiates with a luminosity $L = \epsilon \dot{M}c^{2}$, where
$\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency and where $\dot{M}$ is
estimated from equation (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}).  Then using
equations (\ref{eq:rs_simple}), (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}),
(\ref{eq:rhors}), (\ref{eq:rhostarrs}) we calculate that from equation
(\ref{eq:vw_eff}) that
\begin{align} v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm C} \simeq
  \begin{cases} 13 \eta_{0.02}^{0.5}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.5}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.38}v_{500}^{-1.4}\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}} &, \text{core}\\ 20 \eta_{0.02}^{0.5}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.5}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.24}v_{500}^{-0.7}\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}} &, \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:vC}
\end{align} where $T_{C,9} = T_{C}/10^{9}$ K and $\epsilon_{-2} =
\epsilon/0.01 \sim 1$ is the maximum radiative efficiency for a thick
accretion flow (e.g.~\citealt{Narayan&Yi95}).  Assuming that heating
is dominated by Compton heating ($v_{w} = v_{\rm w,0}^{C}$) one finds
that
\begin{align} v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm C} \simeq
  \begin{cases} 106 \eta_{0.02}^{0.21}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.21}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.21} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.16}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}
&, \text{core}\\ 76 \eta_{0.02}^{0.29}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.29}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.29} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.14}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}
&, \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:vC2}
\end{align} Unless $\eta$ is very high, we conclude that Compton
heating is insufficient to stabilize the steady flow against cooling
instability (e.g. $v_{\rm w,0}^{C} < v_{\rm critt}$;
eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling2}]).

In contrast to radiative feedback, kinetic feedback occurs in the form
of an mass outflow or jet from the viscinity of the black hole, which
deposits its energy at much larger radii.  We assume that the total
heating rate from the SMBH is $\epsilon_{\rm j} \dot{M}c^{2}$, where
$\epsilon_{\rm j} < 1$ is an efficiency factor.  If this energy is
deposited uniformly out to a radius $r_{\rm heat}$ and volume $V_{\rm
heat}$, then the local heating rate $e = \epsilon_{\rm
j}\dot{M}c^{2}/V_{\rm heat}$ results in an effective wind heating rate
of
\begin{eqnarray} v_{w,0}^{\bullet} &\approx& \left(\frac{2t_{\rm
h}\epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}}{V_{\rm heat}\eta
\rho_{\star}}\right)^{1/2} \sim \left(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm
j}\dot{M}c^{2}t_{\rm h}}{\eta M_{\rm enc}}\right)^{1/2} \nonumber \\
&\approx& c\epsilon_{\rm j}^{1/2}\left(\frac{r_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm
heat}}\right)^{1-\Gamma/2},
\end{eqnarray} where we have used the fact that $\dot{M} \approx \eta
M_{\rm enc}(r_{\rm s})/t_{\rm h}$ and that $M_{\rm enc}(r) \propto
M_{\bullet}(r/r_{\rm soi})^{2-\Gamma}$ for radii interior to the outer
break radius (eq.~[\ref{eq:rhostar}]).  Thus for $r_{\rm heat} \sim
r_{\rm s}$, even a small heating efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm j} \sim
10^{-6}$ is sufficient for $v_{\rm w,0}^{\bullet}$ to exceed other
sources of non-accretion powered heating.  However, if the jet
distributes its energy on much larger scales comparable to the galaxy
$r_{\rm heat} \sim $ kpc $\sim 10^{3}r_{\rm s}$ then the heating rate
would be much smaller.

For a fixed heating radius $r_{\rm heat}$ we just see that $v_{\rm
  w,0}^{\bullet} \propto r_{\rm s}^{\beta/2} \propto
M_{\bullet}^{1-\Gamma/2}v_{\rm w,0}^{\Gamma-2}$ is proportional to
$v_{w,0}$ to a negative power, where the last proportionality makes
use of equation (\ref{eq:stag_simple}).  As in the case of Compton
heating, SMBH kinetic heating, when dominant, may thus
``self-regulate".  However, unlike in the case of local stellar wind
heating, SMBH heating may not be thermally stable, since the central
accretion rate does not respond instantaneously to a change in the
thermodynamic properties of the gas on larger scales.  Also note that
$v_{\rm w,0}^{\bullet}$ is proportional to a positive power of SMBH
mass $\propto M_{\bullet}^{1(0.5)}$ for core(cusp) galaxies,
respectively.  This is dependence may have important implications for
the predicted dependence of X-ray luminosity on SMBH mass
($\S\ref{sec:mdot}$).

What is a physically motivated value of the heating radius $r_{\rm
  heat}$?  \citet{Bromberg+11} show that a jet of luminosity $L_{\rm
  j}$ and half opening angle $\theta_{\rm j} = 0.1$ (characteristic of
AGN jets) propagates through a gaseous mass $M_{\rm g}$ to a radius
$r$ in a timescale
\begin{eqnarray}
t_{\rm jet} &\sim& 4000\,{\rm yr}\left(\frac{{L}_{\rm j}}{10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}\right)^{-1/3}\left(\frac{r}{\rm pc}\right)^{2/3}\left(\frac{M_{\rm g}}{10^{8}M_{\odot}}\right)^{1/3} 
\end{eqnarray}
Writing $L_{\rm j} = \epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}$ and approximating $M_{\rm g} \sim \dot{M}t_{\rm ff}$ we find that the ratio of the jet crossing time to the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff} \sim r/\sigma$ is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{t_{\rm jet}}{r/\sigma} \sim 8\times 10^{-5}\sigma_{200}^{2/3}\epsilon_{\rm j}^{-1/3},
\end{equation}
which is notably independent of radius $r$.  Thus we require $\epsilon_{\rm j} \gtrsim 10^{-12}$ for the jet to escape, and if it escapes it is free to travel a long distance. 

\subsection{Combined Heating Rate} 

The total heating rate $\vwO = \sqrt{v_{\rm w,0}^{\star} + v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} + v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm p} + v_{\rm w,0}^{\bullet}}$ has contributions from stellar winds, supernovae, pulsars, and SMBH feedback.  Since pulsar heating appears unlikely to contribute appreciably, and since SMBH heating is uncertain, we first focus on heating from stellar winds and supernovae.  

Figure~\ref{fig:vweff} shows an estimate of how the combined heating
depends on the age of the stellar population $\tage$ and the SMB mass
$\Mbh$.  For $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 1.5\times 10^8 (\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm
  h})^{0.5} \Msun$, SNe Ia occur sufficiently frequently within the
stagnation radius (i.e., $r_{\rm Ia} > r_{\rm s}$; eq.~[\ref{eq:rIa}])
to contribute their full heating rate.  $v_{\rm w,0}^{\rm Ia} \sim
250$ km s$^{-1}$.  On the other hand, for lower mass BHs Ia SNe are
infrequent, in which case main sequence stars ($v_{\rm w,0}^{\star}
\simeq 100-150$ km s$^{-1}$) dominate the heating at most times of
interest.\footnote{Although SN Ia will still occur surrounding low
  mass SMBHs, if they are infrequent interior to the radius where the
  accretion rate is being set, then they will not affect the flow near
  the SMBH at most epochs.}  For very young stellar populations
($\tage \lsim 10^7$ years), $\vwO\simeq 1000$ km s$^{-1}$ due to
contributions from line driven winds from high mass main sequence
stars.
{\bf AG: We should mention that regime with stellar wind heating only
  is likely to be thermally unstable.}

      in the parameter space of SMBH mass $\Mbh$ and age of the

      contribute a constant heating rate $100$ km/s. The contribution
      from SNe Ia is calculated using equation (\ref{eq:vw_sne}), with
      thermalization efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm Ia}=0.4$. The
      contribution from SNe Ia is only added if the $r_s$

      $\rIa$.  {\bf BDM: Correct for dependence of Ia heating on time!

\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

\subsection{Mass accretion rate}
\label{sec:mdot}

For each solution we calculate the accretion rate $\dot{M}$ onto the SMBH in units of the Eddington accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm edd} \equiv L_{\rm edd}/0.1 c^{2}$, where $L_{\rm edd} \approx 1.4\times 10^{46}M_{\bullet,8}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  Figure~\ref{fig:mdot_mass} shows $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ as a function of $\Mbh$ for different
values of $\vwO =$ 300, 600 and 1200 km s$^{-1}$, and for
both core ($\Gamma$=0.1) and cusp galaxies ($\Gamma$=0.8).

For fixed wind heating $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ tends to increase with SMBH mass  $\propto  M_{\bullet}^{0.5(0.8)}$ for core(cusp) galaxies, respectively.  This appears to be in contradiction with the general down sizing trend observed for SMBH accretion in the local
universe (e.g.~\citealt{Heckman+04}; \citealt{Gallo+08}), such as the fact that for quiescent galaxies the nuclear X-ray luminosity obeys $L_X \sim \Mbh^\alpha$, where $\alpha\simeq 0.7-0.8$ \citep{MillerGallo+:2014a}.  Our model instead predicts that $\Mdot
\sim \Mbh^{1.5-2}$, such that if $L_x\sim M$, then we would have $\L_x
\sim \Mbh^{1.5-2}$, steeper than the observed relationship.  

Hower, the mass accretion rate is also a sensitive function of the assumed heating rate, such that $\dot{M}\sim\vwO^{-3.8(-2.4)}$ for a core(cusp) galaxies, respectively.  Thus, only a weak positive dependence of $v_{\rm w,0} \propto M_{\bullet}^{0.25-0.3}$ would be sufficient to explain the trend in X-ray luminosity with BH masses in scenarios where $L_X \propto \dot{M}$, or a somewhat steeper dependence $v_{\rm w,0} \propto M_{\bullet}^{0.35-0.45}$ if $L_{X} \propto \dot{M}^{2}$.  What could cause this dependence?  Maybe Ia SNa...

% This is shown in the top panel Figure~\ref{fig:bh_xray}. The
% relationship from \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a} and their detection
% upper limits are the black and blue solid lines
% respectively. The points correspond to the $\dot{M} c^2$ for our
% solutions (scaled by $5\times 10^{-7}$).  We must choose a $\vwO$ for
% each galaxy.  We select $\vwO$=200 km/s, roughly the expected level of
% heating expected from main sequence the stellar winds and MSPs. If
% $L_x \sim \Mdot^2$ the discrepancy becomes worse, as shown in the
% bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:bh_xray}, where we plot $2 \times
% 10^{-4} (\eddr) \Mdot c^2$ from our solutions with the relation from
% \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a}.


One possible solution that the wind mass loss rate $\eta$ increases
with $\Mbh$, as would be expected if low mass SMBH preferentially
hosted younger stellar populations.  Another possible explanation is
that the effective heating rate of the CNM $v_{\rm w,0}$ decreases
with decreasing SMBH mass.  This could again be due to an older
stellar population, since $v_{w,0} \propto \eta^{-1/2}$ for heating
sources such as SN Ia and millisecond pulsars.
{\bf AG given our new results on stellar wind heating as a function of
Mbh. It seems like the first statement is indeed true but I suspect
vwO actually increases for low Mbh and that this effect actually dominates.}
%, or it could be due to the fact that Ia occur too infrequently inside
%the stagnation radius for low mass black holes.
%AG-We now think that SNe Ia would become important only at the
%highest values of Mbh.

\subsection{Comparison to Observations}
{\bf AG: I do want some discussion of reproducing the density profiles
for individual observations, but I am not sure how to do it with our
new gridded approach.}
% \subsubsection{Comparison to measured temperature and density profiles}
% \citet{AllenDunn+:2006a} use {\it Chandra} X-ray observations to infer the radial temperature and density profiles in the nuclei of nine nearby X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies.  \citet{RussellMcNamara+:2013a} performed a similar analysis with a somewhat enlarged galaxy sample.  Interestingly, these works find a correlation between the accretion rate inferred assuming Bondi accretion and the AGN jet power, which is estimated by the PdV work required to inflate observed cavities in the X-ray emitting gas.  
% % At some point it would be useful to describe the differences between
% % these two sets of observations \citealt{RussellMcNamara+:2013a}
% % tries several different extrapolation schemes for the gas density,
% % and finds that that the uncertainty in extrapolating the density
% % profile is the dominant source of uncertainty in measuring the
% % accretion rate. Find total number which overlaps once the Russell
% % galaxies are included...

% Five of the galaxies in the \citet{AllenDunn+:2006a} sample overlap with that in \citetalias{WangMerritt:2004a}.  We may thus compare our results for the $T$ and $\rho$ profiles with those inferred from observations for the overlapping galaxies.  The results of this exercise are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:allen_compare}.

% Note that we have two free parameters ($\eta$ and $\vwO$) in our
% model, which implies that we can always match the observed temperature
% and densities at at least one point.  As a general rule, we find that
% a wind heating parameter $\vwO=500$ km s$^{-1}$ gives rough agreement
% with the observed temperatures.  We now highlight results for specific
% galaxies.
% % Thus, we choose $\vwO=500$ km/s.  We choose an
% % $\eta$ so that our solution would be consistent with the observed
% % density profiles. The comparison is shown in
% %% AG-The chosen properties, in particular eta may be summarized in a tabe.
% %% AG-Mention rising temperature profiles on large scales.

% \begin{itemize}
% % \item \emph{NGC4486} %eta=0.2
% %   On scales of $\sim1$ kpc the density profile in
% %   \citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a} is shallower than in our model. Our model
% %   has a break in the gas density at $\sim 300$ pc--near the location
% %   of the Nuker break radius for this galaxy at 560 pc. There is an
% %   observed break in the density, but on a scale of a few kpc.

% %   The temperature is assumed to be flat from the resolution limit
% %   inwards in \citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a}. However, in our models $T$
% %   increases monotonically towards the galactic center. This increase
% %   is due to the increased velocity dispersion (and thus increased
% %   heating) towards the galactic center.

% \item \emph{NGC5813} %eta=0.1 
%   The observed density profile (\citealt{RussellMcNamara+:2013a}) is
%   shallower than our calculated density profile, which has a sharp
%   break at $\sim$0.1 kpc, the location of the break radius in the
%   Nuker profile (this is the radius where the stellar light profile
%   transitions from a shallower inner power law slope to a steeper
%   outer power law slope).

%   For this galaxy we found that we could reproduce the observed
%   temperature on large scales with $\vwO=500$ km/s. The increased
%   velocity disperision towards the galactic center results in a sharp
%   increase in $T$ at small radii, which is not captured in the
%   observations due to resolution issues.
% \end{itemize}

% %It would be nice to have error bars for the observational points in this plot...

% %Note currently I reverse-engineer the stellar mass from the black

% Fig. 1 of \citealt{MillerGallo+:2014a} plots the observed

\subsection{Demographics of SMBHs}

Our analytic expression for the accretion rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]) can be translated into the growth time of the SMBH $t_{\rm grow} \equiv M_{\bullet}/\dot{M}$,
\begin{eqnarray}
  t_{\rm growth}/t_{\rm h} \approx 
  \begin{cases}
    250 M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.76}
    v_{500}^{3.8}   \eta_{0.02}  & \text{core} \\
    140 \Mbheight^{-0.48}
    v_{500}^{2.4}   \eta_{0.02}  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:tgrow_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
which we have normalized in terms of the Hubble time.

\subsection{Cooling}
\label{sec:cooling}

  \subsection{Angular Momentum}
  \label{sec:ang}
  Our models are spherically symmetric and do not include the effects of
  the gas' angular momentum. However, galaxies will in general have some
  net rotation, and the gas will generally have some non-zero angular
  momentum. At some radius, $\rcirc$, the specific angular momentum of
  the gas will equal the specific angular momentum of a circular
  orbit. Inside of this radius our assumptions of no rotation and
  spherical symmetry will break down. But if $\rcirc$ is inside of the
  inner sonic point of the flow, the region where angular momentum
  becomes important will be causally disconnected from the rest of the
  flow, and we would be justified in neglecting angular momentum (at
  least on large scales).

  $\rcirc$ depends on the gas injection radius. The largest
  injection radius is $\rs$. Let $\lrs$ be the gas specific angular
  momentum at $\rs$, then 

  \begin{align}
    \rcirc=\frac{\lrs}{G \Mbh}
  \end{align}

  \citet{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a} used two-dimensional kinematic
  data to measure the ratio of ordered to random motion in a sample of
  early type galaxies. More precisely, they measure

  \begin{align}
    \lambda_R=\frac{\left<R|V|\right>}{\left<R\sqrt{V^2+\sigma^2}\right>}
  \end{align}

  Where $R$ is the distance is the distance from the galactic center, $V$ is
  the mean stellar velocity, and $\sigma$ is the velocity
  dispersion. The brackets represent a luminosity weighted average.

  We may rewrite the specific angular momentum at $\rs$ in terms of
  $\lambda_R$.

  \begin{align}
    \lrs\simeq\lambdars \sigma(\rs)^2 \rs^2
  \end{align}

  Then

  \begin{align}
    \rcirc&\simeq\lambdars^2 \frac{\sigma(\rs)^2}{G \Mbh} \rs^2\\
    &\simeq\lambdars^2 \frac{\rs^2}{\rsoi} \lsim \lambdars^2 \rsoi
  \end{align}

  The inner sonic point, $\rss$ general occurs at $\simeq 1\%$ of
  $\rsoi$. {\bf AG need to explain this somehow. Also, note in our
    simulations the inner sonic point is not properly resolved.}
  So if $\lambdars\lsim 0.1$, $\rcirc<\rss$. In Fig. 2 of
  \citet{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a} $\lambda_R$ is plotted as function
  of radius for a sample of early type galaxies. On scales of $\sim 0.1
  R_e$ $\lambda_R$ is either less than 0.1 or rapidly declining for most
  of their sample %%need to be clearer on rapidly declining also compare
  %% this scale to the sphere of influence scale.
  This suggests that angular momentum should generally be unimportant.

\section{Discussion}


If cooling becomes important in the flow ($v_{w} < v_{\rm crit}$), it may lead to thermal instabilities.  There are two kinds of ``instabilities", global and local.  The global instability is simply that, if cooling becomes very rapid, the gas loses thermal pressure and starts to inflow faster, i.e. the entire CNM accretes.  In
practice this should could manifest as a large increase in the stagnation radius, due an effective {\it decrease} in the effective heating rate.  This global ``instability" is not a true instability insofar as the gas does not necessarily clump locally into low-T clouds.

However, \citet{McCourt+12} argue that even if cooling is exactly
balanced by heating everywhere, there is still a local thermal
instability that operates to turn hot gas into cold clouds.  However,
this local instability only causes a significant local drop-out of
mass from the hot medium (to low-T clouds), if the cooling timescale,
\begin{align}
\frac{\tcool}{\tff} &\equiv \frac{3\rho k T/2 \mu \mp}{\dot{q}_{\rm cool}} \approx \frac{9}{5} \left. \frac{q \vw^2/2}{\dot{q}_{\rm cool}}\right|_{\rs}
\end{align} 
is locally shorter than the approximately 10 times the free-fall
timescale $t_{\rm ff}$, where the last equality is evaluated at the
stagnation radius and makes use of equations~(\ref{eq:Tanalytic}) and
(\ref{eq:rhors2}).  We thus see that the condition $v_w \gtrsim v_{\rm
  crit}$ is also the condition for local instability, although the
prefactor may be slightly different.

\subsection{Jet Power Correlation}


Accretion rates onto SMBHs can in principle be estimated directly by assuming Bondi accretion and using high resolution X-ray observations to estimate the gas temperature and density near the Bondi radius.  This technique has led to the intriguing conclusion that the Bondi accretion power correlates with the AGN jet power (e.g.,
\citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a}; \citealt{Russell+13};
\citealt{FujitaKawakatu+:2014a}), the latter estimated from the energy
required to inflate the observed cavities within the X-ray emitting
gas.  In practice is it almost never possible to resolve the Bondi radius, therefore requiring all such studies to extrapolate the observed gas temperature and density profiles to smaller radial scales.  


  \section{Summary}
  \label{sec:summary}
  We have calculated steady-state models for circumnuclear medium of a
  sample of early type galaxies, assuming that gas is supplied
  entirely by stellar wind mass loss and heated by shocked stellar
  winds and SNe Ia. We may use these profiles to calculate an $\Mdot$
  onto each of sample galaxy's SMBH, and get the scaling of $\Mdot$
  with $\Mbh$. We may then compare our results with observed trends of
  nuclear x-ray luminosity. Our main conclusions may be summarized as
  follows.

  \begin{enumerate}
  %Younger population=>higher accretion rate; generally higher eta and
  %lower vw except for very young stellar populations.
  \item We find that $\eddr \propto \Mbh^{\alpha}$, where the value of
    $\alpha$ depends on the slope of the stellar density profile
    ($\alpha\simeq0.5,1$ for cusp and core galaxies respectively). One
    possible solution that the wind mass loss rate (i.e. $\eta$)
    increases with $\Mbh$, as would be expected if low mass SMBH
    preferentially hosted younger stellar populations. Another possible
    explanation is that the effective heating rate of the CNM $v_{\rm w,0}$
    decreases with decreasing SMBH mass. This could again be due to an
    older stellar population, since $v_{\rm w,0} \propto \eta^{−1/2}$
    for heating sources such as SN Ia and millisecond pulsars.
  \item We compare the $\Mdot$ for each of our solution to the one
    calculated from the Bondi formula. We find that they generally to
    a factor of a few. In our model the accretion rate is determined
    from the gas properties at the stagnation radius, $\rs$, which
    agrees with the Bondi radius, $\rb$, within a factor of a
    few. Thus, use of the Bondi formula is a good approximation.
  \item We compare our solutions for density and temperature to those
    inferred from Chandra x-ray observations by \citet{AllenDunn+:2006a}
    and \citet{RussellMcNamara+:2013a} for a handful of galaxies in
    which our sample overlap with theirs. In general, we cannot match
    the observed gas density slope on large scales.
