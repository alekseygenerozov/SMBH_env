\title{Circumnuclear Media and Accretion Rates of Quiescent Supermassive Black Holes}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We calculate steady-state, one-dimensional hydrodynamic profiles of
  hot gas in the nuclei of nominally quiescent galaxies for a range of
  central black hole mass $M_{\bullet}$, parameterized gas heating
  rate, and observationally-motivated stellar density profiles.  Mass
  is supplied to the circumnuclear medium by stellar winds, while gas
  is heated primarily by stellar winds, supernovae, and black hole
  feedback.  Analytic estimates are provided for the stagnation radius
  (where the radial velocity of the gas passes through zero) and the
  black hole mass accretion rate, $\dot{M}$, as a function of black
  hole mass and the gas heating efficiency, the latter of which is
  related to the star-formation history.  We assess the conditions
  under which radiative instabilities develop, separately in the case
  of a single burst of star formation and in the case of the average
  star formation history of galaxies hosting a given black hole
  mass. The measured nuclear X-ray luminosities, $L_{X}$, of a sample
  of quiescent black holes are combined with our results for $\dot{M}$
  to conclude that early-type quiescent black holes in the local
  universe are consistent with accreting in a locally thermally-stable
  state (on scales of the sphere of influence), possibly between
  cycles of thermal instability on larger galactic scales.  The
  maximum accretion rate of a thermally-stable flow is too low to
  explain the short growth times of low mass black holes in the local
  universe.  The latter must instead result from gas being fed in from
  large radii, either due to galaxy mergers associated with
  hierarchical growth or thermal instabilities on larger, galactic
  scales.  Our results have implications for attempts to constrain the
  occupation fraction of SMBHs in low mass galaxies using the mean
  $L_{\rm X}-M_{\bullet}$ correlation, as well as to the diversity of
  circumnuclear media densities encountered by relativistic jets from
  tidal disruption events.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) lurk in the centers of most, if not
all nearby galaxies (see reviews by,
e.g. \citealt{KormendyRichstone:1995a};
\citealt{FerrareseFord:2005a}). However, only a few percent of these
manifest themselves as luminous Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).  Nearly
quiescent SMBHs, such as those hosting low luminosity AGN, constitute
a silent majority (e.g.~\citealt{Ho:2009a}).

Understanding why most SMBHs appear to be inactive requires
characterizing their gaseous environments.  Gas near the sphere of
influence of the SMBH, hereafter the `circumnuclear medium' (CNM),
controls the mass accretion rate, $\dot{M}$.  The accretion rate in
turn sets the luminosity of the black hole and the feedback of this
energy and momentum output on larger physical scales.
The presence of dense gas in the nuclear region may lead to runaway
cooling, resulting in bursty episodes of star formation and AGN
activity (e.g.~\citealt{Ciotti&Ostriker07}; \citealt{Ciotti+10}).

Knowledge of how $\dot{M}$ depends on the SMBH mass, $\Mbh$, and other
properties of the galactic nucleus informs key questions related to
the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies with cosmic time
(e.g.~\citealt{Kormendy&Ho13}; \citealt{HeckmanBest:2014a}).  SMBH growth
in the low redshift universe is dominated by low mass black holes,
$M_{\bullet} \lesssim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$ (e.g.~\citealt{Heckman+04}), a
fact which is often attributed to the general trend of `cosmic
down-sizing' resulting from hierarchical structure growth (e.g,
\citealt{Gallo+08}).  However, the physical processes involved in
growing low mass blacks may be distinct from those operating at higher
SMBH masses and accretion rates in quasars.  A key question is
whether SMBHs grow primarily by accreting gas fed in directly from
galactic or extra-galactic scales, or whether significant growth
results also from internal, secular processes such as local stellar
mass loss in the nuclear region.

A better understanding of what mechanisms regulate accretion onto
quiescent SMBHs would have implications for a variety of observations,
such as constraints on the occupation fraction of SMBHs in low mass
galaxies.  \citet{Miller+15} use the average relationship between the
nuclear X-ray luminosities, $L_{X}$, of a sample of elliptical
galaxies and their associated SMBH masses to infer tentative evidence for a
SMBH occupation fraction less than unity in galaxies with stellar
masses $M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ ($M_{\bullet} \lesssim
10^{7}M_{\odot}$).  This method relies on extrapolating a power-law
fit of the $L_X-\Mbh$ distribution to low values of $L_{\rm X}$ below
the detection threshold.  This assumption is questionable if
different physical processes control the accretion rates onto the
lowest mass SMBHs.

%The conclusions of
%\citet{Miller+15} are thus sensitive to possible changes in
%the $L_X$-$\Mbh$ relationship at small $\Mbh$.
% AG: In our model we obtain a steeper relationship, but we have difficulty matching the observed relationship above the detection threshold

The gas density in galactic nuclei also influences the emission from
stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs), such as the high energy
transient {\it Swift} J1644+57 (\citealt{Levan+11};
\citealt{Bloom+11}, \citealt{Burrows+11}; \citealt{Zauderer+11}).
This transient event was powered by an impulsive relativistic jet,
which produced synchrotron radio emission as the jet material was
decelerated by shock interaction with the CNM of the previously
quiescent SMBH (\citealt{Giannios&Metzger11}; \citealt{Zauderer+11}).
Detailed modeling of J1644+57 showed that the CNM density was much
lower than that measured surrounding Sgr A$^{\star}$
(\citealt{Metzger+12}; \citealt{BergerZauderer+:2012a}).  However, a TDE jet
injected into a denser CNM would be decelerated more rapidly,
producing substantially different radio emission than in J1644+57.
Variations in the properties of the CNM could help explain why most
TDEs appear to be radio quiet (e.g.~\citealt{Bower+13};
\citealt{VanVelzen+13}).

Gas comprising the CNM can in principle originate from several
sources: (1) wind mass loss from predominantly evolved stars; (2)
stellar binary collisions; and (3) unbound debris from a recent TDE.
Stellar wind mass loss is probably the dominant source insofar as
collisions are relevant only in extremely dense stellar environments
for very young stellar populations (\citealt{Rubin&Loeb11}), while
\citet{MacLeod+13} find that TDEs contribute subdominantly to the
time-averaged accretion rate of quiescent SMBHs.

\citet{Ho:2009a} determines the SMBH accretion rates in a sample of
early-type galaxies using X-ray observations to determine the
Bondi accretion rate and based on estimates for the mass loss rate of
evolved stars.  Both methods lead to the conclusion that the available
gas reservoir is more than sufficient to power the observed
low-luminosity AGN, assuming the standard $\sim$ 10 per cent radiative
efficiency for thin disk accretion.  Much
evidence now suggest that low-luminosity AGN result from accretion
proceeding in a radiatively inefficient mode
(\citealt{Yuan&Narayan14}), due either to the advection of
gravitationally-released energy across the SMBH horizon
(e.g.~\citealt{Narayan&Yi95}) or due to the low efficiency with which the inflowing gas ultimately reaches the SMBH
(e.g.~\citealt{Blandford&Begelman99}; \citealt{Li+13}).

%In fact, the temperature profile is assumed to be flat inside of the
%Bondi radius.  In reality, the cusp in the velocity dispersion near
%the SMBH, should cause a cusp in the gas temperature profile (assuming
%the kinetic energy of stellar winds is efficiently thermalized in
%shocks).
%% AG-give sense of scale.

Another approach to determine the SMBH accretion rate, which we adopt
in this paper, is to directly calculate the density, velocity and
temperature profiles of the CNM using a physically motivated
hydrodynamic model.  Mass is injected to the nuclear environment via
stellar winds, while energy input results from several sources
including stellar winds, supernovae, and AGN feedback
(\citealt{Quataert:2004a,De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).
Unlike previous works, which focused primarily on modeling individual galaxies, here
we systematically analyze the CNM properties across a range of galaxy properties, including different SMBH masses, stellar density profiles, and
star formation histories (\citealt{WangMerritt:2004a}).

Past studies, employing multi-dimensional numerical hydrodynamics and
including variety of (parameterized) physical effects, have focused on
massive elliptical galaxies (e.g.~\citealt{Ciotti&Ostriker07};
\citealt{Ciotti+10}).  A key finding of these works is the periodic
development of cooling instabilities on galactic scales, which
temporarily increase the gas accretion rate towards the nucleus until
feedback becomes effective to shut off the flow and halt
SMBH growth.  Here we instead focus on time-independent models,
neglecting radiative cooling.  This approach allows us to
systematically explore the relevant parameter space and to derive
simple analytic expressions that prove useful in exploring whether
cooling instabilities manifest across the expected range of galaxy
properties, or whether other (non-AGN) forms of feedback can result in
steady accretion.  Even if cooling instabilities develop on galactic
scales over longer $\sim$ Gyr timescales, a state of
quasi-steady accretion may exist between these inflow events on
smaller radial scales comparable to the sphere of influence.  We are
thus motivated to explore whether steady flow is achieved within the
nucleus under any circumstances, or whether the gas content is always
building towards instability.
%A chief goal of our analysis is to provide a framework for interpreting the properties of quiescent galactic nuclei given the comparatively well understood physics of stellar winds and supernova heating.

In the presence of strong heating, one-dimensional steady-state flow
is characterized by an inflow-outflow structure, with a critical
radius known as the``stagnation radius" $\rs$ where the radial
velocity passes through zero.  Mass loss from stars interior to the
stagnation radius is accreted, while that outside $\rs$ is unbound in
an outflow from the nucleus.  The stagnation radius, rather than the
Bondi radius, thus controls the SMBH accretion rate (although we will
show that $\rs$ can in many cases reside near the
nominal Bondi radius).  When heating is sufficiently weak, however, no stagnation radius may exist at all, i.e. the entire ISM of the galaxy is flowing towards the SMBH.  A goal of this work is to
assess under what conditions a stagnation radius exists, as this
question is intimately tied to that of cooling instability.
% Furthermore, in some cases we find that no stagnation
% radius exists at all; this formally implies that the entire of ISM of
% the galaxy is feeding the SMBH, potentially resulting in much higher
% accretion rate than would be predicted by simple Bondi accretion. 


This paper is organized as followed.  In $\S\ref{sec:model}$ we

analysis ($\S\ref{sec:gal_model}$) and our numerical procedure for
calculating the steady-state hydrodynamic profile of the CNM
($\S\ref{sec:hydro}$).  In $\S\ref{sec:results}$ we describe some
analytic results, while in $\S\ref{sec:numerical}$ we describe our
numerical results.  In $\S\ref{sec:discussion}$ we discuss the
implications of our results, to topics including the nuclear X-ray luminosities of quiescent black holes, jetted TDEs, and the growth time of SMBHs.  In $\S\ref{sec:conclusions}$ we summarize our conclusions.  Table
\ref{table:definitions} provides the definitions of commonly used
variables.  Appendices \ref{app:rs} and \ref{app:be} provides useful
analytic results, while Appendix \ref{app:windheat} describes our
method for calculating stellar wind heating and mass input in greater
detail.

\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}
\subsection{Galaxy models}
\label{sec:gal_model}
\citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} use Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 imaging to
measure the radial surface brightness profiles for hundreds of nearby
early type galaxies. The measured brightness profile is generally
well-fit by a ``Nuker" law parameterization:
\begin{equation}
  I(\xi)=I_b 2^{(\beta-\Gamma)/\alpha} \xi^{-\Gamma} (1+\xi^\alpha)^{-(\beta-\Gamma)/\alpha}, \,\,\,\xi\equiv\frac{r}{r_b},
\end{equation}
i.e., a broken power law that transitions from an inner power law
slope, $\Gamma$, to an outer power law slope, $\beta > \Gamma$, at a
break radius, $\rb$.  Assuming the stellar population is spherically
symmetric, this corresponds to a stellar density $\rhostar \propto
r^{-1-\Gamma}$ for $r \ll \rb$ and $\rhostar\propto r^{-1-\beta}$ for
$r \gg \rb$.  To good approximation
\begin{align}
\rho_\star = 
\begin{cases}
\rho_\star|_{\rsoi} \left(r/\rsoi\right)^{-1-\Gamma} & r \leq r_b\\
\rho_\star|_{r_b} \left(r/r_b\right)^{-1-\beta} & r > r_b,
\label{eq:rhostar}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\rho_\star|_{\rsoi}$ is the stellar density at the radius of the black hole sphere of influence (soi), 
\begin{equation}
\rsoi \simeq G \Mbh/\sigma^2 \approx 14 M_{\bullet,8}^{0.6}\,{\rm pc},
\label{eq:rsoi}
\end{equation}
where $M_{\bullet,8} \equiv M_{\bullet}/10^{8}M_{\odot}$ and the
second equality in (\ref{eq:rsoi}) employs the $\Mbh-\sigma$
relationship of \citet{McConnellMa+:2011a},
 \begin{align}
M_{\bullet} \simeq 2\times 10^{8}\left(\frac{\sigma}{200\,{\rm
      km\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{5.1}M_{\odot}.
\label{eq:Msigma}
\end{align}
Though of questionable validity for low mass black holes (e.g., \citealt{Greene&Ho07}), we adopt equation (\ref{eq:Msigma}) for lack of a better alternative.

A galaxy model is fully specified by four parameters: $\Mbh$,
$\Gamma$, $r_b$, and $\beta$.  We compute models for three different
black hole masses, $\Mbh = 10^6$, $10^7$, $10^8 \Msun$.  The
distribution of $\Gamma$ in the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} sample is
bimodal, with a concentration of ``core" galaxies with $\Gamma \lsim
0.3$ and a concentration of ``cusp" galaxies with $\Gamma \gsim 0.7$.
We bracket these possibilities by considering models with $\Gamma=0.8$
and $\Gamma=0.1$.  

We fix $\beta = 2$ (a typical value) because our results are generally
not sensitive to the properties of the gas flow on radial scales
$\gtrsim r_b$. The presence of the break radius $r_{b}$ is, however,
necessary to obtain a converged steady state for some regions of our
parameter space.  We consider solutions calculated for up to four
values of $\rb$: 50 pc, 100 pc, 200 pc, and 400 pc, motivated by the
range of break radii from the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a}
sample.\footnote{For the core galaxies the break radius follows the
  scaling relationship $\rb\sim 106 \, (\Mbheight)^{0.39}$ pc, with
  scatter of approximately one dex.  Most the cusp galaxies have $\rb$
  between 100 and 1000 pc, without a clear trend with $\Mbh$.}  In
practice we calculate solutions for a range of $\rb$ only in cases
when its precise value is expected to have a significant affect on the
solution, in particular for high SMBH masses and low heating rates,
for which the stagnation radius approaches large radii.


\subsection{Hydrodynamic Equations}
\label{sec:hydro}

Following \citet{Quataert:2004a} (see also \citealt{HolzerAxford:1970a,De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}), we calculate the density $\rho$, temperature $T$, and radial velocity $v$ of the CNM for each galaxy model by solving the equations of one-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics,
\begin{align}
  &\drhodt+\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r^2 v\right)=q \label{eq:drhodt}\\
  &\rho \left(\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial
      v}{\partial r}\right) =-\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}- \rho\frac{GM_{\rm enc}}{r^{2}} -q v \label{eq:dvdt}\\
  &\rho T\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial
      s}{\partial r}\right)=q\left[\ke+\kew-\gammaf \cs \right] 
, 
\label{eq:dsdt}
\end{align}
where $p$ and $s$ are the pressure and specific entropy, respectively, and $M_{\rm enc} = M_{\star}(r) + \Mbh$ is the
enclosed mass.  We adopt an ideal gas equation of state with $p = \rho kT/\mu m_p$ with $\mu = 0.62$  and $\gamma = 5/3$. 

The source term in equation (\ref{eq:drhodt}),
\begin{align}
  q=\frac{\eta \rhostar}{\th},
\label{eq:q}
\end{align}
represents mass input from stellar winds, which we parameterize in
terms of the fraction $\eta$ of the stellar density $\rhostar$ being
recycled into gas on the Hubble time $\th = 1.4 \times 10^{10}$ yr.
To good approximation $\eta\simeq 0.02 (\tau_{\star}/t_h)^{-1.3}$ at
time $\tau_{\star}$ following an impulsive star burst (e.g.,
\citealt{Ciotti+91})\footnote{\citet{Ciotti+91} give the mass return
  rate from evolved stars as a function of B-band luminosity instead
  of volumetrically, but our expressions are equivalent.}, although
$\eta$ is significantly higher for continuous star formation histories
(bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:vwSources}).

Source terms $\propto q$ also appear in the momentum and entropy
equations (eqs.~[\ref{eq:dvdt}] and [\ref{eq:dsdt}]) because the isotropic injection of mass represents, in the SMBH rest frame, a source of momentum
and energy relative to the mean flow.  Physically, these result from
the mismatch between the properties of virialized gas injected locally
by stellar winds and the mean properties of the background flow.  The
term $\propto -q c_{s}^{2}$ is important because it acts to potentially stabilize the flow to runaway cooling ($\S\ref{sec:instability}$).

The term $\propto \vw^2 = \sigma(r)^2+v_{w}^2$ in the entropy equation
accounts for external heating sources (e.g.,
\citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  The first term approximates the
minimum amount of shock heating from stellar winds due to the random
movement of stars with respect to one another at the characteristic
velocity of 
\be\sigma \approx \sqrt{\frac{3 G \Mbh}{(\Gamma+2)
    r}+\sigma_0^2},
\ee
where the first term is the velocity dispersion of the power law stellar density profile in the SMBH potential.  The second term, $\sigma_0\approx 3 \sigma^2$ is a constant, motivated by the observed velocity dispersion outside of the SMBH sphere of influence \citep{ChaeBernardi+:2014a}, where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion in the $\Mbh-\sigma$
relation (eq.~[\ref{eq:Msigma}]).  The second component of the total heating, $v_{w}^{2}$, parameterizes all additional sources of energy input, including faster winds from young stars, millisecond pulsars, supernovae, AGN feedback, etc.  We assume that $v_w$ is constant with radius, i.e. that the volumetric heating rate is proportional to the local stellar density.  The value of $v_w$ will in general depend on the SMBH mass and the age of the stellar population ($\S\ref{sec:heating}$).  

To isolate the physics of greatest interest, our baseline calculations neglects three potentially important effects: heat conduction, radiative cooling, and rotation.  Electron heat conduction results in an an additional term on the right hand side of the entropy equation of the form:  
\begin{equation}
\dot{q}_{\rm cond} = \nabla\cdot(\kappa \nabla T),
\label{eq:qdotcond}
 \end{equation}
where $\kappa_{\rm
  eff}=\kappa_{\rm spitz}/(1+\psi)$ (\citealt{DaltonBalbus:1993a}) is
the conductivity and $\kappa_{\rm spitz} = \kappa_0 T^{5/2}$ is the
classical \citet{Spitzer62} value ($\kappa_0\simeq 2\times 10^{-6}$ in
cgs units).  The flux limiter $\psi = \kappa_{\rm spitz} \nabla
T/(5\phi \rho c_s^3)$ saturates the conductive flux if the mean free
path for electron coulomb scattering exceeds the
temperature length scale, where $c_s \equiv (kT/\mu m_p)^{1/2}$ is the
isothermal sound speed and $\phi \lesssim 1$ is an uncertain
dimensionless constant (we adopt $\phi = 0.1$).  Even a weak magnetic
field that is oriented perpendicular to the flow could suppress the
conductivity by greatly reducing the electron mean free path.  However, for radially-decreasing temperature profiles
of interest, the flow is susceptible to the magneto-thermal instability (\citealt{Balbus01}), the non-linear evolution of which is believed to result in a radially-directed field geometry (\citealt{Parrish&Stone07}).  We show later in $\S\ref{sec:conductivity}$ that neglecting conductivity results in at most only order-unity errors in the key properties of the solutions.

Radiative cooling contributes an additional term to equation (\ref{eq:dsdt}) of the form
\begin{equation}
\dot{q}_{\rm rad} = -\Lambda(T)n^{2},
\label{eq:qdot_rad}
\end{equation}
where $n = \rho/\mu m_p$ is the gas number density and $\Lambda(T)$ is the cooling function.  We neglect radiative cooling in our baseline calculations, despite the fact that this is not justified when the wind heating $\vwO$ is low or if the mass return rate $\eta$ is high.  However, once radiative cooling becomes important compared to other sources of heating and cooling, its presence leads to thermal instability (e.g.~\citealt{McCourt+12}) that cannot be accounted for by our 1D
time-independent model.  A main goal of this work is to use solutions neglecting radiation to ascertain over what range of physical conditions cooling instabilities are most likely to develop ($\S\ref{sec:instability}$).

Equations (\ref{eq:drhodt})-(\ref{eq:dsdt}) are solved using a sixth
order finite difference scheme with a third order Runge-Kutta scheme
for time integration and artificial viscosity terms in the velocity
and entropy equations for numerical stability
(\citealt{Brandenburg:2003a}).  We assume different
choices of $v_{w} = 300, 600, 1200$ km s$^{-1}$ spanning a
physically plausible range of heating rates.  Although we are interested in the steady-state inflow/outflow solution (assuming one exists), the time-dependent equations are solved to avoid numerical issues that arise near the critical sonic points, of which there are up to two because of the supersonic
inflow on small radial scales and a possible supersonic outflow on large scales.  Also note that our solutions can be scaled to any value of the mass input parameter, $\eta$, since the mass and energy source terms scale linearly with $\rho$ or $\rho_{\star}$; however, the precise value of $\eta$ must be specified when cooling or thermal conduction are included, since these scale as gas density to a different power.  We check the accuracy of our numerical solutions by confirming that mass is conserved across the grid, in addition to the integral constraint on the energy (Bernoulli integral). 



\section{Analytic Results}
\label{sec:results}

We first describe analytic estimates of physical quantities, such as the stagnation radius $\rs$ and the mass accretion rate, the detailed derivation of which are given in Appendix \ref{app:rs}.  Our results are expressed in terms of the SMBH mass $M_{\bullet}$, total heating rate $\tilde{v}_{w}$, and wind mass loss parameter $\eta$.

\subsection{Flow Properties Near the Stagnation Radius}

Continuity of the entropy derivative at the stagnation radius where $v = 0$ requires that the temperature at this location be given by (eq.~[\ref{eq:first_law}])
\begin{align}
T|_{r_{s}}& = \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\frac{\mu m_p
  \tilde{v}_{w}^{2}}{2k} \approx \frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\frac{\mu
  m_p v_w^2}{2k} \frac{3+8\Gamma}{3+8\Gamma-6\nu} \nonumber\\ 
 &\approx
 \begin{cases}
  5.0\times 10^6\ \, v_{500}^2 \,\,{\rm K} & \text{core} \\
  5.5\times 10^6\ \, v_{500}^2 \,\,{\rm K} & \text{cusp},
 \end{cases}
\label{eq:Tanalytic}
\end{align}
where we have assumed $\gamma=5/3$, $v_{500} \equiv v_{w}/(500$ km
s$^{-1}$), $v_w\gg\sigma_0$,  and $\densSlope \equiv -d{\rm ln}\rho/d{\rm ln\,r}|_{r_{\rm
    s}}$ is the density power-law slope at $r = r_{\rm s}$.
Empirically, we find that
\begin{align}
\densSlope \simeq \frac{1}{6} \left(4 \Gamma+3\right).
\label{eq:densSlope}
\end{align}

Hydrostatic equilibrium furthermore determines the value of the stagnation radius (Appendix \ref{app:rs}, eq.~\ref{eq:rs2main})
\begin{align}
  \rs&=\frac{G \Mbh}{\densSlope \vw^2}\left[\frac{13+ 8\Gamma}{4+2\Gamma}\right]\nonumber\\
  &=\frac{G \Mbh}{\densSlope (v_w^{2}+\sigma_0^2)}\left[4
    \frac{\Mstar|_{\rs}}{\Mbh} +\frac{13+
      8\Gamma}{4+2\Gamma}- \frac{3\nu}{2+\Gamma}\right]. 
\label{eq:stag_analytic}
\end{align}
For low heating rates $v_w \ll \sigma_0$, the stagnation radius resides well inside the SMBH sphere of influence.  In this case $\Mstar|_{\rs}/\Mbh \ll1$, such that equation~\eqref{eq:stag_analytic} simplifies to
\begin{align}
  &\rs \underset{v_w \gtrsim \sigma_0}\approx
  \left(\frac{13+8\Gamma}{4+2\Gamma}-
    \frac{3\nu}{2+\Gamma}\right)\frac{G \Mbh}{\nu v_w^2}\nonumber\\
  &\approx \begin{cases} 8
    \, \pc \,\, \Mbheight v_{500}^{-2}\, \pyear& \text{core} \\
    4 \, \pc \,\, \Mbheight v_{500}^{-2} \, \pyear & \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:stag_simple}
\end{align}
where we have used equation~\eqref{eq:densSlope} to estimate
$\densSlope$ separately for
core ($\Gamma = 0.1$; $\densSlope\approx 1$) and cusp ($\Gamma = 0.8$; $\densSlope \approx 0.6$) galaxies.  This
expression is similar to that obtained by \citet{Volonteri+11} on more
heuristic grounds (their eq.~6). 

In the opposite limit of weak heating ($v_w\lsim \sigma_0$) the stagnation radius moves to large radii, approaching the break radius $\rb$ in the stellar density profile, formally implying that almost entire ISM of the galaxy is accreting.  In particular, in Appendix \ref{app:be} we show that $\rs \Rightarrow \rb$ for heating below a critical threshold
\be
\zeta\equiv \frac{\sqrt{v_w^2+\sigma_0^2}}{\sigma_0} < \zeta_c \approx \left(\frac{\rb}{\rsoi}\right)^{0.5(1-\Gamma)}.
\label{eq:zetacrit}
\ee
This result makes intuitive sense: gas is supplied to the nuclear by stars which are gravitationally bound to the black hole, so outflows are possible only if the specific heating rate $\sim v_{w}^{2}$ significantly exceeds the specific gravitational binding energy.  Condition (\ref{eq:zetacrit}) approximately corresponds to the condition that the wind heating parameter be less than the escape speed from the break radius, $v_{\rm esc} \sim (GM_{\star}|_{r_{\rm b}}/r_b)^{1/2}$, where $M_{\star} \propto r^{2-\Gamma}$.

\subsection{SMBH Accretion Rate}

The accretion rate onto the SMBH is given by the total mass loss rate interior to the stagnation radius (eq.~[\ref{eq:q}]), 
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dot{M} &=& 4\pi \int_{0}^{r_{s}}q r^{2}dr = \frac{\eta M_{\star}|_{r_{\rm s}}}{\th} \nonumber \\
&\approx&
  \begin{cases}
    4.5 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{1.76}
    v_{500}^{-3.8}  \eta_{0.02} \Msun \, \pyear& \text{core} \\
    3.2 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{1.48} 
    v_{500}^{-2.4}  \eta_{0.02} \Msun \, \pyear  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:mdot_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have assumed $v_{w} \gg \sigma$ by adopting equation (\ref{eq:stag_simple}) for $r_s$.  The resulting Eddington ratio is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\dot{M}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} &\approx&
  \begin{cases}
    2.0 \times 10^{-5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.76}
    v_{500}^{-3.8}  \eta_{0.02}   & \text{core}, \\
    1.4 \times 10^{-5} \Mbheight^{0.48} 
    v_{500}^{-2.4}  \eta_{0.02}   & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:eddr_analytic}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\dot{M}_{\rm edd} = 2.6M_{\bullet,8}M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is the
Eddington accretion rate, assuming a radiative efficiency of ten per
cent.  Note the sensitive dependence of the accretion rate on
the wind heating rate.
%To reproduce the estimated values $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd} \lesssim 10^{-3}$ in low-luminosity AGN or quiescent galaxies, we thus require $v_{w} \gtrsim 150M_{\bullet,8}^{0.5}$ 

The gas density at the stagnation radius $\rho|_{r_{\rm s}}$ is more
challenging to estimate accurately.  Using an alternative estimate of
$\dot{M}$ as the gaseous mass within the stagnation radius divided by
the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff}|_{r_{\rm s}} = (r_{\rm
  s}^{3}/GM_{\bullet})^{1/2}$,
\begin{align}
  &\dot{M}\sim\frac{(4 \pi/3) \rs^3 \rho|_{r_{\rm s}}}{\tff|_{r_{\rm s}}},
  \label{eq:mdot_gas}
\end{align}
 in conjunction with equations (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}) and (\ref{eq:rs_simple}), one derives
\begin{align}
  \rho|_{r_{\rm s}}\approx
  \begin{cases}
    5.2 \times 10^{-26} \Mbheight^{-0.2} v_{500}^{-0.8}  \eta_{0.02} \,
    \, {\rm g \, cm^{-3}}& \text{core},\\
    1.0 \times 10^{-25}  \Mbheight^{-0.5} v_{500}^{0.6}  \eta_{0.02} \,\, {\rm g \,cm^{-3}} & \text{cusp}.
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rhors}
\end{align}

%Note that by combining equations~\eqref{eq:mdot_analytic}
%and~\eqref{eq:mdot_gas}, one can also write
%\begin{align}
%\rho|_{r_{\rm s}}=\frac{3 q|_{r_{\rm s}} \tff|_{r_{\rm s}}}{2-\Gamma}.
%\label{eq:rhors2}
%\end{align}

Our expression for $\dot{M}$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]) is usefully compared to the Bondi rate for accretion onto a point source from an external medium of specified density and temperature (\citealt{Bondi52}):
\begin{align}
  \dot{M}_{\rm B} =4\pi \lambda r_{\rm B}^2 \rho|_{r_{\rm B}}v_{\rm ff}|_{r_{\rm B}},
\label{eq:bondi}
\end{align}
where $r_{\rm B} \equiv GM/c_{\rm s,ad}^{2}$ is the Bondi radius,
$c_{\rm s,ad} = \sqrt{\gamma kT/\mu m_p}$ is the adiabatic sound
speed, $v_{\rm ff}|_{r_{\rm B}} = r_{\rm B}/t_{\rm ff}|_{r_{\rm B}} =
(GM_{\bullet}/r_{\rm B})^{1/2}$ and $\lambda$ is a parameter of order
unity.

Equation (\ref{eq:mdot_gas}) closely resembles the Bondi formula (eq.~[\ref{eq:bondi}]) provided that $r_{\rm B}$ is replaced by $\rs$.  Indeed, for $r_{s} < r_{\rm soi}$ we have that (eq.~[\ref{eq:stag_simple}])
\begin{align}
  \rs\approx\frac{13+8\Gamma}{4+2\Gamma}\frac{G \Mbh}{\densSlope
    \vw^2} \approx \frac{13+8\Gamma}{12+6\Gamma}r_{\rm B},
  \label{eq:rs_simple}
\end{align}
where the second equality makes use of equation (\ref{eq:Tanalytic}).  

\subsection{Heat Conduction}
\label{sec:conductivity}

Our analytic derivations neglect the effects of heat conduction, an
assumption we now check.  The ratio of the magnitude of the conductive
heating rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:qdotcond}]) to the external heating rate at
the stagnation radius is given by
\begin{align}
  \left.\frac{\nabla\cdot(\kappa \nabla T)}{q v_{\rm
w}^{2}/2}\right|_{r_{\rm s}} &\sim \frac{2t_{\rm h}\kappa_0
T|_{r_{\rm s}}^{7/2}}{r_{\rm s}^{2}\eta \rho_{\star}|_{r_{\rm s}}
\tilde{v}_{w}^{2}}
 \left(1+\frac{\kappa_0 T^{7/2}|_{r_{\rm s}}}{5 \rs
    \phi \rho c_s^3}\right)^{-1}
\nonumber \\ &\sim {\rm min}
  \begin{cases}
  20 \eta_{0.02}^{-1}
M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.8} v_{500}^{6.8} &  \text{unsaturated (core)}\\
 30 \eta_{0.02}^{-1}
M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.5} v_{500}^{5.4} &  \text{unsaturated (cusp)}\\
  2 \phi & \text{saturated},
  \end{cases}
 \label{eq:conduction}
\end{align}
where the second equality makes use of equations (\ref{eq:Tanalytic}),
(\ref{eq:stag_simple}), and we have made the approximations $\nabla^{2} \sim
1/r_{\rm s}^{2}$, $\nabla \sim 1/r_{\rm s}$.  The
stellar density profile is approximated as (eq.~[\ref{eq:rhostar}])
\begin{eqnarray}
  \rho_{\star}|_{r_{\rm s}} &\simeq& \frac{M_{\bullet}(2-\Gamma)}{4\pi r_{\rm soi}^{3}}\left(\frac{r_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm soi}}\right)^{-1-\Gamma} \nonumber \\
 &\approx& \begin{cases}
    7.9 \times 10^{-19}M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.2}v_{500}^{2.2}\,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}
    & \text{core} \\
    2.3 \times 10^{-18} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.5}v_{500}^{3.6}
    \,{\rm g\,cm^{-3}}  & \text{cusp}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:rhostarrs}
\end{eqnarray}
where the stagnation radius is assume to reside well inside the Nuker
break radius.  Equation (\ref{eq:conduction}) shows that, even when conduction is saturated, our neglect of heat conduction
results in at most an order unity correction for plausible, causal values of
the saturation parameter $\phi < 0.1$.  Numerical experiments which include conductive heating confirm this
($\S\ref{sec:numerical}$).




\subsection{Thermal Instability}
\label{sec:instability}

Radiative cooling usually has its greatest impact near or external to
the stagnation radius, where the gas resides in near hydrostatic
balance.  If radiative cooling becomes important, it can qualitatively
alter key features of the accretion flow. Initially hydrostatic gas
that cools at constant pressure $P \propto nT$ at the rate
$\dot{q}_{\rm rad} = n^{2}\Lambda \propto T^{-2.7}$
(eq.~[\ref{eq:qdot_rad}]; see below) is thermally unstable
(\citealt{McCourt+12} and references therein), potentially resulting
in the formation of a multi-phase medium and enhanced star formation.
Even if the hot plasma of the CNM does not condense into cold clouds,
the loss of pressure can temporarily increase the black hole accretion
rate.  When coupled to feed-back processes, the latter can lead to
time-dependent (e.g. limit cycle) behavior
(e.g.~\citealt{Ciotti&Ostriker07}; \citealt{Ciotti+10};
\citealt{Yuan&Li11}, \citealt{Gan+14}), which is also inconsistent
with our assumption of a steady, single-phase flow.

Radiative cooling can, however, be stabilized if it is overwhelmed by
other sources of cooling, namely the term $\propto -q c_{s}^{2}
\propto -qT$ in the entropy equation (eq.~[\ref{eq:dsdt}]).
Neglecting radiative cooling, this term is balanced at the stagnation
radius by the wind heating term, $\dot{q}_{\rm heat} = q
\tilde{v}_{w}^{2}/2$.  Thermal stability near the stagnation radius
can thus be assessed by comparing the ratio of wind heating to
radiative cooling $|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:qdot_rad}]),
\begin{align}
\left.\frac{\dot{q}_{\rm heat}}{|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|}\right|_{\rm r_{\rm s}} \simeq
  \begin{cases}
   630 \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.76}v_{500}^{7.2}  &, \text{core}\\
   660 \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.48}v_{500}^{5.8}  &, \text{cusp},     
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling2}
\end{align}
where we have used equations (\ref{eq:rhors}) and (\ref{eq:rhostarrs})
for the gas and stellar densities at the stagnation radius,
respectively.  We have approximated the cooling function for $T <
2\times 10^{7}$ K as $\Lambda(T) = 1.1 \times 10^{-22} \left(T/10^6
  \text{K}\right)^{-0.7} $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}$ assuming solar
metallicity gas (\citealt{Draine:2011a}; his Fig. 34.1).

To within a constant of order unity, equation (\ref{eq:cooling2}) also
equals the ratio of the gas cooling timescale $t_{\rm cool} \equiv (3n
kT/2 \mu)/\dot{q}_{\rm rad}$ to the free-fall time $t_{\rm ff}$ at the
stagnation radius, as can be derived using the equality

\begin{align}
\rho|_{r_{\rm s}}=\frac{3 q\tff|_{r_{\rm s}}}{2-\Gamma}.
\label{eq:rhors2}
\end{align}
that results by combining equations
\eqref{eq:mdot_analytic},\eqref{eq:mdot_gas}, and
\eqref{eq:rhostarrs}.  \citet{McCourt+12} argue cooling instability
develops in a hydrostatic atmosphere if $t_{\rm cool} \ll t_{\rm ff}$,
so equation (\ref{eq:cooling2}) represents a good proxy for
instability in this case as well.

Based on our numerical results and the recent work of \citet{McCourt+10}) we define thermal stability according to the criterion $\dot{q}_{\rm heat} > 10|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$ ($t_{\rm
  cool} > 10t_{\rm ff}$) being satisfied near the stagnation radius {\bf BDM: decide here}.  This condition translates into a
critical minimum heating rate
\begin{align}
v_{w} > v_{\rm TI} \simeq
  {\rm max}\begin{cases}
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.14} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.11}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}  &, \text{core}\\
   200 \eta_{0.02}^{0.17} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.08}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}   &, \text{cusp}  \\
\sigma_0(\zeta_c^{2}-1)^{1/2} \approx \sigma_0(r_{b}/r_{\rm soi})^{0.5(1-\Gamma)}, 
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:cooling3}
\end{align}
where the final condition corresponds to the low wind heating limit (eq.~[\ref{eq:zetacrit}]), for which the stagnation radius moves out to the break radius $r_b$, resulting in thermal instability.  

The minimum heating rate for thermal stability (eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling2}]) corresponds to maximum thermally-stable accretion rate,
\begin{align}
\frac{\dot{M}_{\rm TI}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} \simeq
  {\rm min}\begin{cases}
   5\times 10^{-4} \eta_{0.02}^{0.47} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.36} &, \text{core}\\
3\times 10^{-6}\eta_{0.02}M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.38}\\
   2\times 10^{-4} \eta_{0.02}^{0.59} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.28}    &, \text{cusp}\\
2.5\times 10^{-4}\eta_{0.02}
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:Mdotmax}
\end{align}
where the first line for each case is derived using equation (\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}) to calculate
$\dot{M}(v_{\rm TI})$, whereas the second line corresponds to the low wind heating limit and is calculated for core galaxies using the empirical correlation $r_{b}/r_{\rm soi} \approx 7.6M_{\bullet,8}^{0.2}$ which follows from equation (\ref{eq:rsoi}) and the results of \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a}.  



% For each of our galaxies Table \ref{tab:eta} provides the maximum value of $\eta$ such that $H/C >$1 at all radii.  Roughly speaking, this is the maximum $\eta$ for which it would be safe to ignore cooling.  If cooling is important, the CNM is likely to be thermally unstable, resulting in the formation of a cold medium that could substantially enhance the rate of accretion onto the SMBH.  

%\begin{align}
 % \Lambda(T)\simeq
  %\begin{cases}
   % 2.3 \times 10^{-24} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{0.5} $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}& \text{if } T \gsim 2 \times 10^7 \text{K} \\
   % 1.1 \times 10^{-22} \left(T/10^6 \text{K}\right)^{-0.7}  $erg cm$^3 $s$^{-1}& \text{if } T \lsim 2 \times 10^7 \text{K}     
  %\end{cases}
  %\label{eq:cooling}
%\end{align}

    galaxies ($\Gamma$=0.8) and thick lines correspond to core
    galaxies ($\Gamma$=0.1). Squares mark the location of
    the stagnation radius for each solution.

  \subsection{Angular Momentum}
  \label{sec:rotation}

  Our spherically symmetric model neglects the effects of angular
  momentum on the gas evolution.  However, all galaxies possess some
  net rotation, resulting in centrifugal forces becoming important at
  some radius $r_{\rm circ} = l^{2}_{r_{s}}/(GM_{\bullet})$.  Here
  $l_{r_{s}} = \langle r V_{\phi}\rangle |_{r_s}$ is the stellar
  specific angular momentum near the stagnation radius, from which
  most of the accreted mass originates, where $V_{\phi}$ is the
  stellar azimuthal velocity.

  \citet{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a} use two-dimensional kinematic data
  to measure the ratio of ordered to random motion in a sample of
  early type galaxies, which they quantify at each galactic radius $R$
  by the parameter
  \begin{align}
    \lambda_R \equiv \frac{\langle r|V|\rangle}{\langle R\sqrt{V^2+\sigma^2}\rangle} \underset{R \ll r_{\rm soi}}\sim \frac{V_{\phi}}{\sigma},
  \end{align}
  where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion and the brackets indicate
  a luminosity-weighted average.  The circularization radius of the
  accretion flow can be written in terms of $\lambda_R$ as

\begin{equation}
\frac{r_{\rm circ}}{r_{s}} \approx \frac{r_{s}}{r_{\rm soi}}\lambda_{R}^{2} \lesssim \lambda_{R}^{2},
\label{eq:rcirc}
\end{equation}
where we have used the definition $r_{\rm soi} \equiv
GM_{\bullet}/\sigma^{2}$ and in the second inequality have assumed
that $r_{\rm s} \lesssim r_{\rm soi}$, a condition which is satisfied
for the thermally-stable solutions of interest.

\citet{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a} (their Fig.~2) find that $\lambda_R$
is generally $< 0.1$ on radial scales $<$ 10 per cent of the galaxy
half-light radius and that $\lambda_R$ decreases with decreasing $R$ interior to this point.  From equation (\ref{eq:rcirc}) we thus conclude that $r_{\rm
  circ} \lesssim 0.01r_{s}$, i.e.~that gas will circularize well
inside the inner sonic point of the flow (typically located at $r\lsim
0.1r_{\rm s}$; Fig.~\ref{fig:profiles}).  Angular momentum should only
become dynamically important for thermally stable flows in a region
that is causally disconnected from the outer part of the flow where
the mass accretion rate is determined.

Our numerical results, summarized in Table \ref{table:models}, allow us to study a range of CNM properties and to assess the validity of the analytic estimates from the previous section.  Cases for which $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|< 10$ {\bf BDM: correct?} at the stagnation radius are marked as `thermally unstable', as are cases for which the stagnation radius diverges and hence could not be resolved, resulting in their calculations being terminated.  

Figure~\ref{fig:profiles} shows profiles of the density $\rho(r)$,
temperature $T(r)$, and radial velocity $|v(r)|$ (expressed in units of the sound speed), for the cusp
($\Gamma=0.8$) solutions within our grid.  As expected, the gas
density increases towards the SMBH $\rho\propto r^{-\densSlope}$ with
$\densSlope\simeq1$, i.e. shallower than the $-3/2$ power law for
Bondi accretion. This power law behavior does not extend
through all radii, however, as the gas density profile has a break coincident
with the location of the break in the stellar light profile ($\rb=100$
pc). The temperature profile is relatively flat at large radii, but
increases as $\propto 1/r^{k}$ interior to the sphere of influence,
where $k\lesssim 1$, somewhat shallower than expected for virialized gas within the black hole sphere of influence.
The inwardly directed velocity increases towards the hole with a profile that is somewhat steeper than the local free-fall velocity $v \propto v_{\rm ff}\propto r^{-1/2}$.  The flow near the stagnation radius is subsonic, but becomes supersonic at two critical points, one located at small radii, $r \lesssim 0.1r_{\rm s}$, and the other located at large radii, $r \gtrsim 10^{3}r_{\rm s}$.  In many cases the supersonic transition is instigated by the transition to a steeper stellar density profile exterior to the outer Nuker break radius, making our solutions near $r_{\rm s}$ also potentially sensitive to the break radius value.

Figure~\ref{fig:stag} shows our calculation of the stagnation radius $r_{\rm s}/r_{\rm
  soi}$ as a function of the wind heating parameter $\zeta = \sqrt{v_w^{2}+\sigma_0^{2}}/\sigma_0$, with different colors showing different values of $v_{w}$.  Cusp and core galaxies are marked with square and triangles,
respectively.  Shown for comparison are our analytic results
(eq.~[\ref{eq:rs2main}]) with solid and dashed lines for cusp and core
galaxies, respectively, calculated assuming $\densSlope = 1$ and
$\densSlope= 0.6$, respectively (eq.~[\ref{eq:densSlope}]).  

Our analytic estimates accurately reproduce the numerical results in the high heating limit $\zeta \gg 1$ ($v_w \gg \sigma_0$; $r_{\rm s} \lesssim r_{\rm soi}$).  However, for sufficiently low heating the stagnation radius diverges above the analytic estimate, approaching the stellar break radius $r_b \gg r_{\rm soi}$.  This divergence occurs approximately when $\zeta = \sqrt{v_w^{2}+\sigma_0^{2}}/\sigma_0 < \zeta_c \propto (r_b/r_{\rm soi})^{0.5(\Gamma-1)}$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:zetacrit}], Appendix \ref{app:be}), and hence occurs at a higher value of $\zeta$ in the case of core galaxies ($\Gamma = 0.8$) with large break radii.  This behavior explains the three core galaxies shown as green squares, which are vertically aligned at the same value of $\zeta$ close to where the analytic estimate diverges; these correspond to models with the same black hole mass ($\Mbh = 10^7 \Msun$) and heating rate ($v_w = 300$ km s$^{-1}$) but different values of the break radius: $r_{b} = $ 50, 100, and 400 pc (from top to bottom) corresponding to successively larger values of $\zeta_c$.  

 Figure~\ref{fig:mdot_mass} shows the SMBH accretion rate for each of our numerical solutions in Eddington units for different values of $\vwO =$ 300, 600 and 1200 km s$^{-1}$, and for both core ($\Gamma$=0.1) and cusp galaxies ($\Gamma$=0.8).  Shown for comparison is our analytic estimate of $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ from equation (\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}).  For high wind velocities ($v_{w} \gg \sigma$) the stagnation lies well inside the black hole sphere of influence and our analytic estimate provides a good fit to the numerical results.  However, for low wind velocities and/or high $M_{\bullet}$ (large $\sigma$), the numerical accretion rate considerably exceeds the analytic estimate as the stagnation radius diverges to large radii (Fig.~\ref{fig:stag}).

\end{figure}


Fig.~\ref{fig:cooling} shows the ratio of wind heating to radiative
cooling, $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$
(eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling2}] and surrounding discussion) as a function of
radius for our fiducial solutions shown in Figure \ref{fig:profiles}.
For high heating rates of $v_{w} = 600$ and $1200$ km s$^{-1}$ cooling
is unimportant across all radii, while for $v_{w} = 300$ km s$^{-1}$
we see that $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$ and $\tcool/\tff$
can be less than unity, depending on the wind mass loss parameter
$\eta$.  At the stagnation radius, the ratio $\dot{q}_{\rm
  heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$ reaches a value that lies within a factor
of two of its minimum across the entire grid; thus, the value of
$(\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|)_{r_{s}}$ provides a
diagnostic of thermal instability for the entire solution.

Also note that for $v_{w}=600$ and $1200$ km s$^{-1}$ we have that
$\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}| \sim t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$
near the stagnation radius.  However, the two ratios diverge from each
other at low heating ($v_{w} \lesssim 300$ km s$^{-1}$) because
equations (\ref{eq:mdot_gas}), (\ref{eq:rhors}) underestimate the true
gas density, which is greater in a subsonic inflow (weak heating) than
in a supersonic outflow (strong heating).

In addition to our standard set of solutions neglecting thermal conduction and cooling, we explore a few test simulations including these effects, as marked by dagger symbols in Table \ref{table:models}.  For solutions which are far from being thermally unstable when cooling is neglected (e.g. $M_{\bullet} = 10^{8}M_{\odot}$, $v_{w} = 600$ km s$^{-1}$, $r_{b} = 100$ pc, $\eta = 0.2$, $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}| = 76$), the effects of including radiative cooling on the key properties of the flow (stagnation radius, mass accretion rate, $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$ ratio) are small.  However, for solutions in which cooling stability is marginal (e.g. $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}| \sim $few), including cooling decreases the value of $\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|$ by a greater fraction.  Likewise, we find that the key properties of solutions including thermal conduction are always minor for our choice of the saturation parameter $\phi = 0.1$, and they act to offset the effects of radiative cooling, i.e. to make the flow more thermally stable (e.g.~\citealt{Zakamska&Narayan03}).  

\section{Sources of Heating}
\label{sec:heating}

Key properties of the flow, such as the SMBH accretion rate and the likelihood of thermal instability depend sensitively on the assumed heating rate $\propto qv_{w}^{2}$.  This section summarizes individual heating sources, providing estimates of the value of
\begin{align}
  v_{w} = \sqrt{\frac{2 t_h \dot{e}}{\eta \rhostar}}
  \label{eq:vw_eff}
\end{align}
for each, where $\dot{e}$ is volumetric heating rate.  

\subsection{Stellar winds} 

Energy and mass input to the CNM by stellar winds is the sum of contributions from main sequence and post-main sequence populations.  At early times following star formation, energy input is dominated by core collapse supernovae and by the fast outflows of Wolf-Rayet stars (e.g., \citealt{VossDiehl+:2009a}).  At later times energy input is dominated by main sequence winds (e.g., \citealt{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a}).  Mass input is also dominated by massive stars for very young stellar populations, but for most stellar ages the slow AGB winds of evolved low-mass stars dominate the mass budget.  

In Appendix \ref{app:windheat} we calculate the wind heating rate from
stellar winds, $v_{\rm w}^{\star}$, and the mass loss parameter,
$\eta$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:q}]), as a function of age, $\tau_{\star}$, of a
stellar population which is formed impulsively (Fig.~\ref{fig:vwImp}).  
At the earliest times ($\tau_{\star} \lesssim 10^{7}$ yr), the wind
heating rate exceeds 1000 km s$^{-1}$, while much later ($\tau_{\star}
\sim t_{\rm h}$) stellar wind heating dominated by main sequence winds
is much lower, $v^{\star}_{\rm w} \sim 50-100 $ km s$^{-1}$.  We show
in $\S\ref{sec:combined}$ that for the case of quasi-continuous star
formation representative of the average star formation history of loss
mass galaxies, the stellar wind heating rate produced by stellar winds
can also be significant, $v_{\rm w}^{\star} \sim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$.  
Stellar winds thus contribute a potentially important source of both
energy and mass for the CNM.  An additional uncertainty in the stellar wind heating rate results from the uncertain thermalization efficiency of massive stellar winds.  We assume this efficiency to be unity, an optimistic assumption which is offset by our neglect of energy input from core collapse supernovae, which contribute an energy comparable to that from massive stellar winds.  

\subsection{Type Ia Supernovae} 

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) represent a potentially important source of heating, which unlike core collapse SNe is present even in an evolved stellar population.  If each Ia supernova injects thermal energy $E_{\rm Ia}$ into the interstellar medium, and the SNe rate (per stellar mass) is given by $R_{\rm   Ia}$, then the resulting volumetric heating rate of $E_{\rm Ia}R_{\rm  Ia}$ produces an effective wind heating parameter (eq.~[\ref{eq:vw_eff}]) of \begin{align} v_{w}^{\rm Ia} =\sqrt{\frac{2 t_h R_{\rm Ia}
E_{\rm Ia}}{\eta}} \label{eq:vw_sne}.
\end{align} The thermal energy injected by each SN Ia, $E_{\rm Ia} \simeq
\epsilon_{\rm Ia} 10^{51}$ erg, depends on the efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm Ia}$
with which the initial blast wave energy is converted into bulk or turbulent
motion instead of being lost to radiation.  \cite{Thornton+98}
estimate a radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm Ia} \sim 0.1$,
depending weakly on surrounding density, but \citet{Sharma+14} argues
that $\epsilon_{\rm Ia}$ can be considerably higher, $\sim 0.4$, if
the SNe occur in a hot dilute medium, as may characterize the circumnuclear medium.  Hereafter we adopt $\epsilon_{\rm Ia} = 0.4$ as fiducial.

The SN Ia rate, $\RateIa$, depends on the age of the stellar population, as it represent the convolution of the star formation rate and the Ia delay time distribution (DTD) divided by the present stellar mass.  In
the limit of impulsive star formation, $\RateIa$ is the DTD evaluated at the time since the star formation episode.  The observationally-inferred DTD (Fig. 1 of \citealt{MaozMannucci+:2012a}) has the
approximate functional form \begin{align}
  R_{\rm Ia} =1.7\times 10^{-14}\left(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm
      h}\right)^{-1.12} M_{\odot}^{-1}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}
\label{eq:DTD}
  \end{align}
  where $\tau_{\star}$ is the time since star formation.

From equations (\ref{eq:vw_sne}), (\ref{eq:DTD}) we thus estimate that 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
    v_{w}^{\rm Ia} &\approx& 700(\epsilon_{\rm
      Ia}/0.4)^{0.5}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.56}\eta_{0.02}^{-1/2}\,{\rm km
      \,s^{-1}} \nonumber \\
&\approx& 700(\epsilon_{\rm
      Ia}/0.4)^{0.5}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.09}\,{\rm km
      \,s^{-1}},
\label{eq:vIa}
  \end{eqnarray}
where the second line assumes $\eta\simeq 0.02 (\tau_{\star}/t_h)^{-1.3}$ for a single burst of star formation (e.g. , \citealt{Ciotti+91}).

The high value of $v_{w}^{\rm Ia}$ implies that Ia SNe represent an
important source of CNM heating.  However, SNe can only be
approximated as supplying heating which is spatially and temporally
homogeneous if the rate of SNe is rapid compared to the characteristic
evolution time of the flow at the radius of interest
(\citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a}).  We define the ``Ia radius"
  \begin{align}
    r_{\rm Ia} \sim \left(\frac{G}{R_{\rm Ia}\sigma}\right)^{1/2} \sim
    38 M_{\bullet,8}^{-0.1}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.56}\,{\rm pc}
    \label{eq:rIa}
  \end{align}
  as the location exterior of which the time interval between
  subsequent supernovae $\tau_{\rm Ia} \sim (M_{\rm enc}R_{\rm
    Ia})^{-1} \sim G/(r\sigma^{2}R_{\rm Ia})$ exceeds the local
  dynamical timescale $t_{\rm dyn} \sim r/\sigma$, where we again
  adopt the Ia rate for an old stellar population and in the final
  equality we estimate the velocity dispersion using the
  $M_{\bullet}-\sigma$ relationship (eq.~[\ref{eq:Msigma}]).

Assuming that $v_{w}^{\rm Ia} \gg \sigma$ then by substituting
$v_{w}^{\rm Ia}$ (eq.~\ref{eq:vIa}) into equation (\ref{eq:rs_simple})
for the stagnation radius, we find that

\begin{align}
  \left.\frac{r_{\rm Ia}}{r_{\rm s}}\right|_{\rm v_{w}^{\rm Ia}}&\approx
  \begin{cases}
    8\, \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm
     Ia}/0.4) (\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.56}  & {\rm core}\\
    17\, \eta_{0.02}^{-1} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm
     Ia}/0.4) (\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.56} &{\rm cusp}\\
   \end{cases} \nonumber\\
 &\approx 
 \begin{cases}
    8\, M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm
     Ia}/0.4) (\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.74}  & {\rm core}\\
    17\, M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.1}(\epsilon_{\rm
     Ia}/0.4) (\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{0.74} &{\rm cusp}\\
   \end{cases}
\label{eq:rIars}
\end{align}
If $r_{\rm Ia} \gg r_{\rm s}$, then SN Ia heating can only be
approximated as a steady heating source near the stagnation radius for
extremely massive SMBHs with $M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^9 \Msun$ or in
the case of a very young stellar population ($\tau_{\star} \ll t_{\rm
h}$).  

%On the other hand, equation (\ref{eq:rIars}) may underestimate
%the importance of Ia heating because $r_{\rm Ia}/r_{\rm s}$ will be
%substantially smaller than its value estimated using $v_{w}^{\rm Ia}$
%if the heating rate excluding SN Ia is less than this.

Even if SN Ia are rare near the stagnation radius, they may cap the
SMBH accretion rate by periodically blowing gas out of the nucleus of
low mass galaxies.  Between successive supernovae, stars release a
gaseous mass $M_{\rm g} \approx \eta M_{\star}\tau_{\rm Ia}/t_{\rm h}$
interior to the Ia radius, which is gravitationally bound to the SMBH
by an energy $E_{\rm bind} \sim M_{\rm g}\sigma_0^{2}f^{2}$, where $f \sim 1$ for cusp galaxies and $f \sim$ few for core galaxies due to the greater escape speed from core galaxies.  

According
to the above definitions, we thus find that 
\be
E_{\rm Ia}/E_{\rm bind} \sim (v_{w}^{\rm Ia})^{2}/2f^{2}\sigma^{2}.  
\ee
Hence, for low mass BHs with $\sigma_0 \ll f v^{\rm Ia}_{w}/2$, SN Ia are capable of dynamically clearing out gas from radii $\sim r_{\rm Ia} \gtrsim r_{\rm s}$.  Thus, even when heating is sufficiently weak for the stagnation radius to formally exceeds $r_{\rm Ia}$, the SMBH accretion rate is limited to a value
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\dot{M}_{\rm Ia}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} &\approx& \frac{\eta M_{\bullet}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd} t_{\rm h}}\left(\frac{r_{\rm Ia}}{r_{\rm soi}}\right)^{2-\Gamma} \approx \nonumber \\
 && \begin{cases}
    4.5 \times 10^{-4} M_{\bullet,8}^{-1.33}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.2}
   & \text{core} \\
    2.2 \times 10^{-4} \Mbheight^{-0.84}(\tau_{\star}/t_{\rm h})^{-0.6}   & \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:eddr_Ia}
\end{eqnarray}
obtained substituting the Ia radius $r_{\rm Ia}$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:rIa}]) for $r_{\rm s}$ in the derivation leading to our estimate of $\dot{M}$ (eq.~[$\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}$]).  Note, however, that for low mass black holes $\dot{M}_{\rm Ia}$ generally exceeds the maximum accretion rate for a thermally stable flow $\dot{M}_{\rm TI}$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:Mdotmax}]), implying that dynamical `blow-out' from SNe Ia cannot alone prevent cooling instabilities in the nuclei of low mass galaxies.  

The deep potential wells of high mass galaxies $\sigma \gg f v^{\rm Ia}_{w}$ prevent SN Ia from dynamically clearing out gas.  Equation (\ref{eq:eddr_Ia}) may nevertheless cap the accretion rate in practice because, even if other source of heating are ineffective, the Ia heating rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:vIa}]) is sufficiently great to prevent the stagnation radius from substantially exceeding $r_{\rm Ia}$.

%Also note that Ia supernovae only cap the accretion rate to this maximum value if the gas feeding the black hole is supplied by local stellar mass loss: the gaseous mass can become much greater if the nucleus is fed externally, e.g. due to a galaxy merger or to cooling flows developing within the galaxy over much longer timescales (e.g.~\citealt{Ciotti&Ostriker07}). 



\subsection{Millisecond Pulsars}
 Energy injection from the magnetic braking of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a potentially
important heating source.  If the number of MSPs per unit stellar mass
is $n_{\rm msp}$ and each contributes on average a spin-down
luminosity $\bar{L}_{\rm sd}$, then the resulting heating per unit
volume $\dot{e} \approx \bar{L}_{\rm sd}n_{\rm msp}\epsilon_{\rm msp}$ results in an
effective heating rate (eq.~ [\ref{eq:vw_eff}]) of 
\begin{eqnarray} v_{w}^{\rm MSP} \sim
30\left(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm msp}}{0.1}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{\bar{L}_{\rm
sd}}{10^{34}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}}\right)^{1/2} \eta_{0.02}^{-1/2}\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}},
 \label{eq:vmsp}
  \end{eqnarray} 
where $\epsilon_{\rm msp}$ is the thermalization efficiency of
the wind, normalized to a value $\lesssim 0.1$ based on that inferred by modeling the interstellar media of globular clusters
\citep{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a}.  Our numerical estimate assumes a
pulsar density $n_{\rm msp} \sim 3 \times 10^{-40} $ MSPs g$^{-1}$, calculated from the estimated $\sim 30,000$ MSPs in the Milky Way (\citealt{Lorimer13}) of stellar mass $\approx 6\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$.

Based on the ATNF radio pulsar catalog (\citealt{Manchester+05}), we estimate the average spin-down luminosity of millisecond pulsars in the field to be $\bar{L}_{\rm sd} \sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, resulting in $v_{w}^{\rm MSP} \lesssim 30$ km s$^{-1}$ for $\eta \gtrsim 0.02$.  For higher spin-down
luminosities, $L_{\rm sd}\simeq 10^{35}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ characteristic
of some Fermi-detected pulsars, then the higher value of $v_{w}^{\rm MSP}
\lesssim 300$ km s$^{-1}$ makes MSP heating in principle important
under the most optimistic assumptions $\epsilon_{\rm msp} = 1$ and $\eta = 0.02$.  On the other hand, it seems likely that the stellar binaries giving rise to MSPs could be disassociated by stellar interactions in the dense nuclear cluster, reducing the numbers of MSPs as compared to the field population estimate above.  


\subsection{SMBH Feedback}

Feedback from accretion onto the SMBH represents an important source of heating which, however, is also the most difficult to quantify (e.g., \citealt{Brighenti&Mathews03}, \citealt{DiMatteo+05}; \citealt{Kurosawa&Proga09}; \citealt{Fabian12} for a recent review).  A key difference between AGN heating and the other sources discussed thus far is its dependence on the SMBH accretion rate $\dot{M}$, which is itself a function of the heating rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}]).  

\subsubsection{Compton Heating}

There are two types of SMBH feedback: kinetic and radiative.
Radiative feedback is potentially effective even in low luminosity AGN
via Compton heating (e.g., \citealt{Sazonov+04}, \citealt{Ciotti+10}),
which provides a volumetric heating rate (\citealt{Gan+14})
\begin{align}
\dot{e} = 4.1\times 10^{-35}n^{2}\xi T_{\rm C}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}},
\end{align}
where $\xi = L/n r^{2}$ is the ionization parameter and $L$ is the SMBH luminosity with Compton temperature $T_{\rm C} \sim 10^{9}$ K $\gg T$ (e.g., \citealt{Ho99}, \citealt{Eracleous+10}).  

The importance of Compton heating can be estimated by assuming the SMBH
radiates with a luminosity $L = \epsilon \dot{M}c^{2}$, where
$\epsilon$ is the radiative efficiency and where $\dot{M}$ is
estimated from equation (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}).  Then using
equations (\ref{eq:rs_simple}), (\ref{eq:mdot_analytic}),
(\ref{eq:rhors}), (\ref{eq:rhostarrs}) we calculate that from equation
(\ref{eq:vw_eff}) that the effective heating rate at the stagnation radius is given by
\begin{align} v_{w}^{\rm C} \simeq
  \begin{cases} 27 \eta_{0.02}^{0.5}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.5}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.38}v_{500}^{-1.4}\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}} &, \text{core}\\ 30 \eta_{0.02}^{0.5}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.5}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.5} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.24}v_{500}^{-0.7}\,{\rm
km\,s^{-1}} &, \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:vC}
\end{align} where $T_{C,9} = T_{C}/10^{9}$ K and $\epsilon_{-2} =
\epsilon/0.01 \sim 1$.  We caveat that, unlike stellar wind heating,
Compton heating depends on radius, scaling as $v_{w}^{\rm C}(r)
\propto (n^{2}\xi/\rho_{\star})^{1/2} \propto
r^{(\Gamma-\densSlope-1)/2}$, i.e. $\propto r^{-0.6}$ and $\propto
r^{-0.75}$ for core ($\Gamma = 0.8$; $\densSlope \simeq 1$) and cusp
($\Gamma = 0.1$; $\densSlope \simeq 0.6$) galaxies, respectively.  Our
model's assumption that the heating parameter be radially constant is
not satisfied, but this variation is sufficiently weak that it should
not significantly alter our conclusions.

If Compton heating acts alone, i.e. $\tilde{v}_{w} = v_{w}^{C}$, then
solving equation (\ref{eq:vC}) for $\tilde{v}_{\rm w}$ yields
\begin{align} v_{w}^{\rm C} \simeq
  \begin{cases} 140 \eta_{0.02}^{0.21}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.21}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.21} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.16}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}
&, \text{core}\\ 95 \eta_{0.02}^{0.34}T_{\rm
C,9}^{0.29}\epsilon_{-2}^{0.29} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.14}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}
&, \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:vC2}
\end{align} 
Compton heating can thus be significant in young stellar populations
with relatively high mass loss rates, e.g. $v_{w}^{\rm C} \gtrsim 300$
km s$^{-1}$ for $\eta \gtrsim 1$.  The mass accretion rate
corresponding to the state where Compton heating limits the average
accretion rate is given by substituting equation (\ref{eq:vC2}) into
equation (\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}):
\begin{align}
\frac{\dot{M}_{C}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} \approx 
\begin{cases} 2\times 10^{-3} \eta_{0.02}^{0.2}T_{\rm
C,9}^{-0.8}\epsilon_{-2}^{-0.8} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.16}
&, \text{core}\\ 8\times 10^{-4} \eta_{0.02}^{0.3}T_{\rm
C,9}^{-0.7}\epsilon_{-2}^{-0.7} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.14}
&, \text{cusp},
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:MdotCa}
\end{align}
If the accretion luminosity $\epsilon = 10 \dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$
depends on the Eddington ratio as predicted by some models for
radiatively inefficient accretion flows (\citealt{Narayan&Yi95};
\citealt{Narayan+98}; \citealt{XieYuan:2012a}), then the Compton-limited accretion rate becomes
\begin{align}
\frac{\dot{M}_{C}}{\dot{M}_{\rm edd}} \approx 
\begin{cases} 1.7\times 10^{-2} \eta_{0.02}^{0.12}T_{\rm
C,9}^{-0.44}M_{\bullet,8}^{0.09}
&, \text{core}\\ 8.6\times 10^{-4} \eta_{0.02}^{0.17}T_{\rm
C,9}^{-0.4} M_{\bullet,8}^{0.08}
&, \text{cusp}.
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:MdotC}
\end{align}
%{\bf  Total efficiency is 10 (mdot/MdotEdd). Everywhere.}


\subsubsection{Kinetic Feedback}

Kinetic feedback results from outflows of energy or momentum from close to the black hole in the form of a disk wind or jet, which deposits its energy as heat, e.g. via shocks or wave dissipation, over much larger radial scales (e.g.~\citealt{McNamara&Nulsen07}; \citealt{Novak+11}; \citealt{Gaspari+12}).  

Assume that the outflow power is proportional to the SMBH accretion rate, $L_{\rm j} =
\epsilon_{\rm j} \dot{M}c^{2}$, where $\epsilon_{\rm j} < 1$ is a jet efficiency factor.  Further assume that this energy is deposited as heat uniformly interior to a radius $r_{\rm heat}$ and volume $V_{\rm heat} \propto r_{\rm
heat}^{3}$.  The resulting volumetric heating rate $e = \epsilon_{\rm
j}\dot{M}c^{2}/V_{\rm heat}$ near the stagnation radius results in a heating parameter given by
\begin{eqnarray} v_{w}^{\bullet} &\approx& \left(\frac{2t_{\rm
h}\epsilon_{\rm j}\dot{M}c^{2}}{V_{\rm heat}\eta
\rho_{\star}|_{r_{s}}}\right)^{1/2} \sim \left(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm
j}\dot{M}c^{2}t_{\rm h}}{\eta M_{\rm enc}}\right)^{1/2} \nonumber \\
&\approx& 300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}\,\left(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm j}}{10^{-6}}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{r_{\rm s}}{r_{\rm
heat}}\right)^{1-\Gamma/2},
\label{eq:vjet}
\end{eqnarray} 
where we have used the facts that $\dot{M} = \eta M_{\star}|_{r_{\rm s}}/t_{\rm h}$ and, for radii inside the Nuker break radius, $M_{\star}(r) \propto
M_{\bullet}(r/r_{\rm soi})^{2-\Gamma}$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:rhostar}]).  If the bulk of the outflow energy is released near the stagnation radius, then even a small heating efficiency $\epsilon_{\rm j} \gtrsim
10^{-5}$ is sufficient for $v_{w}^{\bullet}$ to exceed other sources of non-accretion powered heating.  However, if this energy is instead deposited over much larger physical scales comparable to the size of the galaxy, i.e. $r_{\rm heat} \gtrsim $ 10 kpc $\sim 10^{4}r_{\rm s}$, then kinetic feedback is unimportant, even for a powerful jet with $\epsilon_{\rm j} \sim 1$.  

Using the results of \citet{Bromberg+11}, the time required for a jet of luminosity $L_{\rm
  j}$ and half opening angle $\theta_{\rm j} = 0.1$ (characteristic of
AGN jets) to propagate through a gaseous mass $M_{\rm g}$ of radius $r$ is estimated to be
\begin{eqnarray}
t_{\rm jet} &\sim& 4000\,{\rm yr}\left(\frac{{L}_{\rm j}}{10^{40}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}\right)^{-1/3}\left(\frac{r}{\rm pc}\right)^{2/3}\left(\frac{M_{\rm g}}{10^{8}M_{\odot}}\right)^{1/3} 
\end{eqnarray}
Approximating $M_{\rm g} \sim \dot{M}t_{\rm ff}$, the ratio of the jet escape timescale to the dynamical timescale $t_{\rm dyn} \sim r/\sigma$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{t_{\rm jet}}{t_{\rm dyn}} \sim 7\times 10^{-3}M_{\bullet,8}^{0.13}\left(\frac{\epsilon_{\rm j}}{10^{-6}}\right)^{-1/3},
\end{equation}
independent of $r$.  A jet with power sufficient to appreciably heat
the CNM on radial scales $\sim r_{\rm s}$ ($\epsilon_{j} \gtrsim
10^{-6}$) also necessarily has sufficient power to escape the nuclear
region and propagate to much larger radii.  Slower outflows from the
accretion disk, instead of a collimated relativistic jet, may provide
a more promising source of feedback in these systems
(e.g.~\citealt{Li+13}).

As in the case of Compton heating, kinetic heating could in principle
`self-regulate' the accretion flow insofar as a lower heating rate
results in a higher accretion rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:vjet}]), which in
turn may create stronger jet feedback.  However, given the uncertainty
in the efficiency of jet heating, we defer a more detailed discussion
to $\S\ref{sec:kinetic}$.

\subsection{Combined Heating Rate} 
\label{sec:combined}


The total gas heating rate, 
\begin{equation}
\vwO = \sqrt{(v_{w}^{\star})^{2} + (v_{w}^{\rm MSP})^{2} + (v_{w}^{\rm Ia})^{2} + (v_{w}^{\bullet})^{2}},
\label{eq:vtot}
\end{equation}
includes contributions from stellar winds, supernovae, pulsars, and radiative SMBH feedback.  The strength of each heating source depends explicitly on the SMBH mass and the stellar population in the galactic nuclear region.  The latter could best be described by a single star burst formation in the past, or by a more continuous star formation history that itself varies systematically with the galaxy mass and hence $\Mbh$.

\subsubsection{Single Starburst}

Figure~\ref{fig:vwSourcesImp} shows the contributions of various heating sources as a function of time $\tau_{\star}$ after a burst of star formation for black holes of mass $\Mbh = 10^{6} \Msun$ (top panel) and $\Mbh = 10^{8} \Msun$ (bottom panel). The heating and mass input parameters due to stellar winds, $v_{w}^{\star}(\tau_{\star})$ and $\eta(\tau_{\star})$, are calculated as described in Appendix~\ref{app:windheat} (Fig.~\ref{fig:vwImp}).  The heating from SN Ia ($v_{w}^{\rm Ia}$) and Compton heating ($v_{\rm w}^{\rm C}$) are calculated from equations~\eqref{eq:vIa} and~\eqref{eq:vC} respectively, also making use of $\eta(\tau_{\star})$ from stellar winds.  SN Ia heating depends also on a convolution of the DTD (eq. [\ref{eq:DTD}]) and the star formation history, which reduces to the DTD itself for a single star burst.  We crudely account for the expected suppression of SN Ia heating resulting from its non-steady nature by attenuating $v_{w}^{\rm Ia}$ by a factor $e^{-\rs/\rIa}$, where $r_{\rm Ia}$ is the radius exterior to which the time between subsequent supernovae exceeds the local dynamical time (eq.~[\ref{eq:rIa}]).  Finally, note that $v_{\rm w}^{\rm C}$ and $v_{\rm w}^{\rm Ia}$ also depend on the total heating rate (eq.~[\ref{eq:vtot}]), requiring us to simultaneously solve a series of implicit equations to determine each heating rate.  Heating from MSPs is found to be negligibly small for fiducial parameters and hence is not shown, while kinetic feedback is neglected given its uncertain efficiency ($\S\ref{sec:kinetic}$).  

For low-mass black holes, stellar winds are the most important source of heating on
timescales of less than a few tens of millions of years.  Compton
heating comes to dominate at later times due to the higher accretion
rates that accompany the overall decrease in the heating rate, coupled
with the persistently high mass loss rates and gas densities associated with a relatively young
stellar population.  Compton heating dominates at all epochs for
higher mass black holes, with stellar winds and Ia SN competing for
the most significant non-AGN heating source.  As the total heating
rate declines with time, after some point the flow becomes thermally
unstable according to the criterion $(\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm
  rad}|)_{r_{s}} \lesssim 1$ (eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling3}]), as shown by
dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:vwSourcesImp}.  The thermal stability is
calculated neglecting Compton heating because the latter may not be
capable of truly stabilizing the flow given its inability to respond
instantaneously to local changes in the properties of the gas.
Thermally unstable flow is seen to be the norm in the single starburst
case, except at very early times, $\tau_{\star} \lesssim 1-3 \times
10^7$ yr.

\subsubsection{Continuous Star Formation History}
A single burst of star formation does not describe the typical star
formation history of most galaxies.  Qualitatively, smaller galaxies
will on average have more recent star formation, resulting in
energetic young stellar winds and supernovae which dominate the gas
heating budget.  Massive galaxies, on the other hand, will on average
possess older stellar populations, with their heating rates dominated
by SN Ia (on large radial scales) and SMBH feedback.  We estimate the
average value of $\vwO$ as a function of SMBH mass for each heating
source by calculating its value using the average cosmic star
formation histories of \citet{MosterNaab+:2013a}.  Appendix
\ref{app:windheat} describes how the average star formation history is
used to determine the stellar wind heating $v_{\rm w}^{\star}$ and
mass return parameter $\eta$ as a function of $M_{\bullet}$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:vwSources}; top panel).  Star formation histories are also
convolved with the Ia DTD distribution to determine the SN Ia heating.

Figure~\ref{fig:vwSources} shows $\vwO(M_{\bullet})$ from each heating
source (stars, MSPs, SNe Ia, and black hole feedback) calculated for
the average star formation history of galaxies containing a given
black hole mass.  Again, Ia heating is suppressed in low mass galaxies
because the Ia radius exceeds the nominal stagnation radius (bottom
panel).  MSP heating is again found to be negligible for all black
hole masses.  The younger stellar populations characterizing galaxies
with $\Mbh\lsim 5\times 10^{8} \Msun$ are dominated by stellar wind
and Ia heating, with $v_{w}^{\star} \sim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$v_w^{\rm Ia} \sim 500$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.  Only for the most
massive galaxies, with $\Mbh\gsim 5\times 10^{8} \Msun$, does the lack
of young stellar populations significantly reduce the role of stellar
wind
heating.  %Solid and dashed lines again show black hole masses for which the flow is thermally stable and thermally unstable, respectively, with $(\dot{q}_{\rm heat}/|\dot{q}_{\rm rad}|)_{r_{s}}$ as a function of $M_{\bullet}$ shown in the bottom panel.
Strikingly, {\it we find that galactic nuclei experiencing the same
  average star formation history as their host galaxies produce
  thermally stable flows across almost all black hole masses}.  One exception may occur for the highest mass black holes, for which the total heating velocity is comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion and thermal stability for the average star formation history is marginal ($\S\ref{sec:mdot}$).
{\bf AG: I wouldn't put too much stock in this since for higher masses
vw is comparable to sigma, and thus rs should run away to large
radii. This is especially true for core galaxies.}

Realistic variations (``burstiness") in the star formation history
will often result in lower heating rates.  Figure \ref{fig:NickPlot2}
shows the heating rate as a function of average black hole mass for
non-fiducial cases in which the current ($z = 0$) star formation is
suppressed by a factor $\zeta$ from its average $z = 0$ value, for a
characteristic timescale $t_{\rm scale}$ (for details, see Appendix
\ref{app:windheat}).  For $t_{\rm scale} \lesssim 10^{7}$ yr, we see
that $v_{\rm w}^{\star}$ is reduced by at most a factor of $\approx 2$
from its average value, even for huge drops in the star formation rate
($\zeta \sim 10^{-3}$).  However, burstiness in the star formation
history over longer timescales can suppress heating more
significantly.  When $t_{\rm scale} \gtrsim 10^8~{\rm yr}$, $v_{\rm
  w}^\star$ becomes very sensitive to $\zeta$: at $\zeta=0.1$, $v_{\rm
  w}^\star \approx 500~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ in most galaxies, but for
smaller $\zeta$, $v_{\rm w}^\star \approx 200~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$ (an
exception to this is in galactic nuclei with $M_\bullet \gtrsim
5\times 10^8~M_\odot$, where heating is stabilized by SN Ia).  Our use
of average cosmic star formation histories is appropriate provided
local variations are either on short timescales ($t_{\rm scale}
\lesssim 10^7~{\rm yr}$), or limited in magnitude ($\zeta \gtrsim
0.1$).  If both of these conditions are violated, then the effective
heating rates for all but the most massive galaxies (where Ia
explosions dominate) will fall by a factor $\approx 5$ from our
fiducial volumetric averages, taken from \citet{MosterNaab+:2013a}.


\section{Implications and Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Black Hole Accretion Rates}
\label{sec:mdot}

Figure \ref{fig:vwSources} shows that the heating associated with the
average star formation history of a galaxy is approximately constant
with SMBH mass, except for the largest black holes with $M_{\bullet}
\gtrsim 5\times 10^{8}M_{\odot}$.  For a fixed wind heating parameter,
the Eddington ratio $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd}$ increases $\propto
M_{\bullet}^{0.5(0.8)}$ for core(cusp) galaxies, respectively
(Fig.~\ref{fig:mdot_mass}; eq.~[\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}]).

Figure \ref{fig:bh_growth} (top panel) shows with solid lines the
accretion rate as a function of black hole mass for the average star
formation heating, calculated from equation (\ref{eq:eddr_analytic})
using our results for the total wind heating
(Fig.~\ref{fig:mdot_mass}).  This average accretion rate increases
from $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for low-mass
black holes ($M_{\bullet} \sim 10^{6}M_{\odot}$) to $\dot{M} \sim
10^{-4}M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for $M_{\bullet} \sim 10^{9}M_{\sun}$.
These fall below the maximum thermally stable accretion rate,
$\dot{M}_{\rm TI}$ (plotted as yellow lines), except at the highest
black hole masses $\sim 10^{9}M_{\odot}$.  For these highest mass
black holes, the maximum accretion rate as set by gas blow-out from SN
Ia (green lines; eq.~[\ref{eq:eddr_Ia}]) could instead cap the
accretion rate below the thermally-unstable value, provided that the
SN Ia heating efficiency is sufficiently high that $v_{\rm w}^{\rm Ia}
\gg \sqrt{2}\sigma \sim 400$ km s$^{-1}$ (see discussion just
preceding eq.~[\ref{eq:eddr_Ia}]).  This is only possible if the Ia
heating efficiency is higher $\epsilon_{\rm Ia} > 0.1$ than normally
assumed (\citealt{Sharma+14}) and if the galaxy is a core.  For lower mass black holes, the
maximum accretion rate set by SN Ia is significantly higher and cannot
also prevent the development of thermally unstable flows,
i.e. $\dot{M}_{\rm Ia} \gg \dot{M}_{\rm TI}$.

Shown also for comparison in Figure \ref{fig:bh_growth} (top panel) is the accretion rate onto SgrA* calculated by \citet{Quataert:2004a}, as well as the range of $\dot{M}$ for the low-luminosity AGN NGC3115 from \citealt{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a} (who find a range of accretion rates depending on the assumed model for thermal conductivity, although they do not include saturation of the conductive flux).  The SgrA* rate exceeds our estimate of $\dot{M}$ due to the average star formation history for galaxies with the same mass black hole by almost two orders of magnitude.  This discrepancy can be understood by the fact that star formation in the central parsec of the Galaxy is not in steady-state: feedback is instead dominated by the stellar winds from the ring of young massive stars of mass $\sim 10^{4}M_{\odot}$ and estimated age $\sim 10$ Myr (e.g., \citealt{Schodel+07}).  Such a star formation history is better described as a `burst' of stars, for which the value of $\eta \sim 100$ at $\tau_{\star} = 10^{7}$ yr (Fig.~\ref{fig:vwImp}) is a factor of $\sim 100$ times higher than the value of $\eta \sim 1$ predicted in the average SFH case (Fig.~\ref{fig:vwSources}, bottom panel).

\subsection{Nuclear X-ray Luminosities}
\label{sec:Lx}

The (unresolved) core X-ray luminosities of galactic nuclei provide a
powerful diagnostic of the SMBH accretion rates and how they vary with
SMBH mass and other galaxy properties (e.g., \citealt{Ho08} and
references therein).  Figure~\ref{fig:miller} shows our predictions
for $\langle L_{X} \rangle =\epsilon_X \dot{M} c^2$ as a function of
black hole mass, where $\epsilon_{X} = \epsilon\epsilon_{\rm bol}$,
$\epsilon$ is the total radiative efficiency, and $\epsilon_{\rm bol}
\sim 0.1$ is the bolometric correction into the measured X-ray band
for low luminosity AGN (\citealt{Ho08}).  The value of $\langle L_X
\rangle$ is calculated using the average accretion for galaxies with
core ($\Gamma = 0.1$) and cusp ($\Gamma = 0.8$) stellar density
profiles, using the relationship $\Gamma = 0.3 \Mbheight^{-0.24}$ fit
to the \citet{LauerFaber+:2007a} galaxy sample.

The left panel of Figure \ref{fig:miller} is calculated assuming a
constant low value for the radiative efficiency of $\epsilon_X = 10^{-4}$,
typical of those estimated for low luminosity AGN (e.g.,
\citealt{Ho:2009a}), while the right panel luminosities are calculated
instead assuming an efficiency of $\epsilon_X= 10 \epsilon_{\rm bol}\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm
  edd}$ that depends on the Eddington ratio as predicted by some
models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows
(\citealt{Narayan&Yi95}; \citealt{Narayan+98}).  Shown for comparison
are the X-ray measurements (green stars) and upper limits (gray
triangles) from the sample of early-type galaxies compiled by \citet{Miller+15}
(cf.~\citealt{Gallo+10}).  A green line shows the best power-law fit
to the X-ray luminosity from \citet{Miller+15}, given by $\langle
L_X/L_{\rm edd}\rangle \sim \Mbh^\alpha$ with $\alpha = -0.2$ (see also
\citep{Zhang+09, Pellegrini10, Gallo+10}).  Also shown are the maximum accretion rates,
respectively, for thermally stable accretion (eq.~[\ref{eq:Mdotmax}]; yellow),
as set by SN Ia blow-out (eq.~[\ref{eq:eddr_Ia}]; teal), and as allowed by
Compton heating feedback (eq.~[\ref{eq:MdotC}]; red).

\end{figure*}

If the nuclei of elliptical galaxies are heated in a way similar to that due to the average star formation history of galaxies with
similar mass, then to first order we predict that $\langle
L_{X}/L_{\rm edd}\rangle$ should increase with black hole mass, though
only weakly for $M_{\bullet} \lesssim 3\times 10^{8}M_{\odot}$.  This
result is in tension with the observed down-sizing trend that the
average Eddington ratio is seen to decrease (albeit also weakly)
with $M_{\bullet}$.  However, one must keep in mind the enormous uncertainty in calculating the
luminosity of the accretion flow close to the black hole in a single
waveband based on the feeding rate on larger scales.  If disk outflows carry away most of the infalling mass before it reaches X-ray producing radii (e.g.~\citealt{Blandford&Begelman99}; \citealt{Li+13}), then the
angular momentum of the infalling gas might also influence the X-ray luminosity, in a way
that could depend systematically on the stellar population and hence $M_{\bullet}$.

Perhaps a more readily addressable test is whether a steady-state accretion
picture can account for the the large scatter, typically of $2-3$ orders of magnitude, in $L_{X}/L_{\rm
  edd}$ at fixed $M_{\bullet}$.  Scatter could result from at 
least three effects: (1) intrinsic scatter in the scaling relationships ($\Mbh-\sigma$ and $\Mbh-L_{\rm
  bulge}$) used to measure $\Mbh$; (2) the strong sensitivity of the accretion rate to
the stellar wind velocity, $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd} \propto
v_{w}^{-3.8(-2.4)}$ for core(cusp) galaxies, respectively
(Fig.~\ref{fig:mdot_mass}; eq.~[\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}]).  When 
combined with the significant dependence of $v_w$ on stochastic
intermittency in the star formation history (Appendix
\ref{fig:NickPlot2}), this can lead to order of magnitude differences
in $\dot{M}$; (3) differences angular momentum of the infalling gas
from galaxy to galaxy, resulting in differences in the fraction of the
gas lost to outflows, $\Mbh$.  Also potentially contributing is the
order of magnitude difference, at fixed $v_w$ and $M_{\bullet}$,
between $\dot{M}$ for core and cusp galaxies
(Fig.~\ref{fig:bh_growth}).  Differences in $\dot{M}$ are augmented by
the expectation that $L_{\rm X} \propto \dot{M}^{2} $ for radiatively
inefficient flows {\bf AG: Don't forget differences in eta}. 



%Many of the upper
%limits on $L_{\rm X}$ at low $M_{\bullet}$ may in fact correspond to a
%separate ``thermally stable" population.  This possible dichotomy
%calls into question the use of simple extrapolations of power-law fits
%to the $L_{\rm X}(M_{\bullet}$) relationship to low $M_{\bullet}$ to
%constrain the occupation fraction of black holes in low mass galaxies
%(\citealt{Miller+15}).


\subsection{Steady Accretion versus Cyclic Outbursts}
\label{sec:cycle}

It is also possible that many of the galactic nuclei from the
\citet{Miller+15} sample are not accreting in a steady fashion.  The
efficiency assumed in the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:miller} in
some ways represents a maximum value, since it does not take into
suppression of the accretion rate due to disk outflows on small
scales.  If the actual X-ray efficiency is lower than assumed, then
many of the detections in the case of low SMBH masses, $M_{\bullet}
\lesssim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$, would lie even further above above the
predicted average value for stable accretion (black line).  These
galaxies either experience significantly lower levels of heating than
average galaxies of their mass, or that they are not accreting stably
at all.  Indeed, for the lowest mass holes, $M_{\bullet} \lesssim
10^{8}M_{\odot}$, $L_{\rm X}$ nearly exceeds that predicted for the
maximum thermally-stable accretion rate, $\dot{M}_{\rm TI}$ (yellow
line).  It is not surprising that this sample is more likely to be
thermally unstable as compared to an average galaxy with this black
hole mass, because the \citet{Miller+15} sample includes only
early-type galaxies with on average older stellar populations.

Figure \ref{fig:bh_growth} (top panel) also shows that across all
black hole masses, Compton heating also cannot prevent average
accretion rates which are thermally unstable, i.e. $\dot{M}_{\rm C} >
\dot{M}_{\rm TI}$.  In the case of thermal instabilities, nuclear gas
may undergo cyclic oscillations of rapid cooling and high accretion
rates, followed by quiescent periods once gas has been consumed and/or
AGN feedback becomes effective.  Such cycles are proposed to occur on
large scales and long timescales in elliptical galaxies
(\citealt{Ciotti+10}), an idea possibly supported by, e.g., GALEX
observations showing that a small fraction of early-type galaxies in
the local universe have undergone recent ($< 1-2$ Gyr old) star
formation episodes (\citealt{Donas+07}).  Similar cyclic AGN activity
have been proposed to occur on the smaller scale of the sphere of
influence (e.g.~\citealt{Yuan&Li11}, \citealt{Cuarda+15}).

If such cyclic outbursts also manifest on the properties of gas on
small, parsec scales, then the large scatter in the accretion rates
and hence X-ray luminosities in Fig \ref{fig:miller} could result from
the wide range of inflow rates experienced over the course of a cyclic
episode between instabilities and periodic nuclear outbursts
(e.g.~\citealt{Ciotti+10}).  Due to their deeper potential well, we
find that core galaxies are more likely to possess higher accretion
rates and potentially be thermally unstable for a fixed wind heating
rate than cusp galaxies (Fig.~XXX).  This could help explain why core
galaxies show a wide range of nuclear radio and X-ray luminosities
(suggesting cyclic accretion episodes), while cusp galaxies are
confined below a threshold (e.g., \citealt{Bender+89, Pellegrini99,
  Capetti&Balmaverde05}), consistent with thermally-stable,
steady-state picture. ({\bf AG: This picture may be dubious...Review
  the literature but I think that the higher upper bound for cores is
  just due to a mass selection effect.})

If the galaxies with measured $L_{\rm X}$ at low $M_{\bullet}$ in Fig
\ref{fig:miller} represent thermally-unstable galaxies, then many of
the upper limits may correspond to a separate ``thermally stable"
population, for instance including SgrA*.  The possibility of a mixed
population of stable versus unstable galaxies calls into question the
use of simple extrapolations of power-law fits to the $L_{\rm
  X}(M_{\bullet}$) relationship to low $M_{\bullet}$ to constrain the
occupation fraction of black holes in low mass galaxies
(\citealt{Miller+15}).

%The cyclic model predicts that high $L_{X}$ nuclei should be more
%common in galaxies with younger stellar ages, a result which appears
%in tension with the finding by \citet{Pellegrini10} that galaxies with
%younger stellar populations are observed to host less X-ray luminous
%nuclei, at least for stellar ages $<3$ Gyr.  An alternative
%explanation for this observation within a thermally stable,
%steady-state accretion picture is that young stars provide higher
%stellar wind heating, reducing the mass accretion rate and hence
%nuclear X-ray luminosity.  {\bf AG Challenge: \citet{HeckmanBest:2014a}
 % find that ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$ (a proxy for the bolometric luminosity)
  %${\rm L_{[OIII]}/M_\star}$ (a proxy for the Eddington ratio)
  %increases with decreasing 4000 $\AA$ break index (decreasing stellar
 % age) (see their Figure 14). This suggests that the accretion rate is
  %actually increasing towards younger stellar ages. At young ages
  %there actually seems to be plenty of gas around, which may be
  %obscuring the x-rays and causing an anamolously low measurement of
  %$L_X$. 
  
  %For a starburst the black hole accretion rate lags the star
  %formation rate by 200 Myr (\citet{WildHeckman+:2010a} Figure
 % 9). This could be due to SNe feed back suppressing the black hole
  %accretion rate (massive star winds do the same thing by themselves,
 % but they cannot be sustained for 200 Myr.

\subsection{Local Growth Time of SMBHs }
\label{sec:growth}

Low-mass AGN in the local universe ($M_{\bullet} \lesssim 3\times
10^{7}M_{\odot}$) are observed to be growing on a timescale comparable
to the age of the universe, while the most massive SMBHs with
$M_{\bullet} \gtrsim 10^{9}M_{\odot}$ possess local growth times which
are more than 2 orders of magnitude longer (\citealt{Heckman+04};
\citealt{Kauffmann&Heckman09}).

The bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:bh_growth} shows the SMBH growth
time, $t_{\rm grow} = M_{\bullet}/\dot{M}$, for each accretion rate
shown in the top panel.  For black holes accreting steadily given the
stellar wind heating associated with the average star formation
history of their galaxies, we see that $t_{\rm grow}$ exceeds the
Hubble time by 1$-$3 orders of magnitude across all black hole masses.
Steady accretion therefore cannot explain the growth of low mass black
holes, a fact which is not surprising given that approximately half of
this growth occurs in AGN radiating within 10 per cent of their
Eddington rate (\citealt{Heckman+04}).  Such high accretion rates
likely instead require an source of gas external to the nuclear
region, triggered either by galaxy mergers associated with the
hierarchical growth of structure or thermal instabilities on larger,
galactic scales (e.g.~\citealt{Ciotti+10}).  In support of this,
\citet{Kauffmann&Heckman09} find that the growth of low mass black
holes is dominated by young stellar bulges which have a log normal
distribution of Eddington ratios peaked at $\Mdot/\MdotEdd\sim
0.01$. That this distribution is insensitive to galaxy properties
suggests that it is set by SMBH feedback instead of the nuclear gas
supply.

That the growth time associated with thermally-unstable accretion
(yellow line) exceeds the Hubble time across all SMBH masses
highlights the fact that significant black hole growth in the local
universe cannot result from thermally-stable steady accretion of gas
lost from the surrounding stellar population studied in this paper.
Gas blow-out by SN Ia cannot prevent the growth of low-mass black
holes, as indicated by the low growth times $\ll t_{\rm h}$ allowed by
Ia heating (green lines), although Ia heating could play in principle
a role in capping the growth rate of $\gtrsim 10^{8}M_{\odot}$ black
holes, again depending on the efficiency of Ia heating and whether the
galaxy is a core or cusp.


\subsection{TDE Jets}
\label{sec:TDE}

Our results also have implications for the environments encountered by
relativistic jets from TDEs.  For low-mass SMBHs $M_{\bullet} \lesssim
10^{7}M_{\odot}$, characterizing those responsible for {\it Swift}
J1644+57 (\citealt{Bloom+11}), we predict gas densities of a $n
\sim 0.3-3$ cm$^{-3}$ on radial scales of 0.3 pc for wind heating
rates within the physically expected range $v_{\rm w} \sim 500-1000$
km s$^{-1}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:profiles}).  These values are within the
range estimated by modeling the radio afterglow of {\it Swift}
J1644+57 (\citealt{Metzger+12}, \citealt{BergerZauderer+:2012a}).  

\citet{BergerZauderer+:2012a} infer a flattening of the gas density
profile on radial scales $r \gtrsim 0.4$ pc (their Fig.~6) which looks
qualitatively similar to that the density profile we predict for core
galaxies (Fig.~\ref{fig:profiles}, solid line), although to obtain
such a flattening on the inferred radial scale, would require a large
$\Mbh\sim 10^7 \Msun$.  Their inferred gas profile also shows a break
at radii $\sim 0.6$ pc, which in our model corresponds to the break
radius of the galaxy and hence would imply an unrealistically small
SMBH mass $\Mbh\simeq 100\Msun$.  according to the mean relationship
from the \citet{Lauer+Faber:2007a} sample. A more likely explanation
is that the observed break in the gas density is associated with a
break in a nuclear star cluster in the galaxy {\bf AGs-ref Carson et
  al. 2015.}. 

More detailed models for the environment, and the implications of our
models for CNM profiles for the diversity of radio emission from TDE
jets, will be explored further in future work.

\subsection{Regulation by Kinetic Outflow Feedback}
\label{sec:kinetic}

We focused on Compton radiative feedback in this paper, since its
efficacy was straightforward to calculate in terms of the properties
of the accretion flow.  However, if kinetic outflow feedback from the
jet or accretion disk could is important, this could also have some
influence on limiting the accretion rate, especially onto high mass
black holes.  The effective wind heating velocity due to kinetic
heating rate is proportional to the SMBH mass to a positive power,
$v_{w}^{\bullet} \propto M_{\bullet}^{0.33(0.28)}$ for core(cusp)
galaxies, respectively (eq.~[\ref{eq:vjet}]).  Coupled with the
dependence of accretion rate on wind heating, $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm
  edd} \propto M_{\bullet}^{0.76(0.48)}v_{w}^{-3.8(-2.4)}$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:mdot_mass}; eq.~[\ref{eq:eddr_analytic}]), SMBH heating
of the formed we have adopted would lead to an Eddington ratio
dependence $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm edd} \propto
M_{\bullet}^{-0.5(-0.2)}$.  This prediction of an increasing Eddington
ratio is in better with the observed dependence of $\langle
L_{X}/L_{\rm edd} \rangle$ in elliptical galaxies
(Fig.~\ref{fig:miller}), suggesting a possible explanation of stable
accretion maintained by kinetic feedback as an alternative explanation
for X-ray luminosities of elliptical galaxies.  On the other hand, our
assumption that outflows heat the gas uniformly in volume is arbitrary
and would need to more rigorously justified by numerical studies of
how jets or disk outflows couple energy to their gaseous environment
(Refs).

For a fixed $r_{\rm heat}$, the effective heating rate from kinetic outflows $v_{\rm w}^{\bullet} \propto r_{\rm s}^{1-\Gamma/2} \propto M_{\bullet}^{1-\Gamma/2}v_{w}^{\Gamma-2}$ is proportional to $v_{w}$
to a negative power (where we have used of eq.~[\ref{eq:stag_simple}]).  Thus, as in the case of Compton heating, kinetic heating could in principle  `self-regulate' insofar as a lower heating rate results in a higher accretion rate, which in turn results in stronger jet feedback.  
However, although both radiative and kinetic feed-back process seem capable of producing sufficient heating to offset radiative cooling and prevent instability (e.g., $v_w \gtrsim v_{\rm TI}$; eq.~[\ref{eq:cooling3}]), this is somewhat misleading because black hole feedback depends on the central accretion rate, which (unlike stellar feedback) does not respond instantaneously to changes in the thermodynamic properties of the gas on larger scale.  Thus, even if the AGN heating balances cooling on average, the flow may still experience limit cycle behavior in this case (\citealt{Yuan&Li11}).   


{\bf AG Challenge: Except in the most massive systems the jet duty
  cycle is rather low (0.001-0.01). The jets tend to overheat the gas,
  and then periodically turn once the gas begins to cools
  (Refs). Thus, jets cannot be treated as a truly steady source of
  heating. 
}

%\subsection{Jet Power Correlation}

%Accretion rates onto SMBHs can in principle be estimated directly by assuming Bondi accretion and using high resolution X-ray observations to estimate the gas temperature and density near the Bondi radius.
%This technique has led to the intriguing conclusion that the Bondi accretion power correlates with the AGN jet power (e.g.,
%\citealt{AllenDunn+:2006a}; \citealt{Russell+13}; \citealt{FujitaKawakatu+:2014a}), the latter estimated from the energy
%required to inflate the observed cavities within the X-ray emitting gas.  In practice is it almost never possible to resolve the Bondi radius, therefore requiring all such studies to extrapolate the observed gas temperature and density profiles to smaller radial scales.

\subsection{Nuclear Star Clusters}

Our results could in principle also have implications for nuclear star clusters or globular clusters.  {\bf BDM :Do we really want to talk about this?  or is this an apology? I will let Aleksey fill in his ideas...}


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}


We have calculated steady-state models for circumnuclear medium of
quiescent galaxies, assuming that gas is supplied entirely by stellar
wind mass loss and heated by shocked stellar winds, supernovae and
black hole feedback. We compute profiles for a range of different
black hole masses, heating rates, and stellar density profiles and use
these profiles to calculate an $\Mdot$ onto each galaxy's SMBH, and
get the scaling of $\Mdot$ with $\Mbh$. We may then compare our
results with observed trends of nuclear x-ray luminosity with galaxy
properties. Our main conclusions may be summarized as follows.

  \begin{enumerate}
  %Younger population=>higher accretion rate; generally higher eta and
  %lower vw except for very young stellar populations.
  \item The gas will be divided between an accretion flow and an
    outward flow at the stagnation radius, $\rs$. In a steady state
    the gas inflow rate towards the hole will be proportional to the
    stellar mass enclosed inside of $\rs$. 
  \item The location of the stagnation radius and thus the accretion
    rate is quite sensitive to the effective heating rate of the
    gas. In our model gas is supplied by stellar winds and the kinetic
    energy of the winds is thermalized as the winds
    collide. Supernovae and AGN feedback may provide additional
    sources of heating. Each source of heating is related to the star
    formation history of the galaxy.  For example, a galaxy with star
    formation within the last $\sim10^7$ years would have mass
    injection from very fast stellar winds ($w_w\simeq 1000$ km/s). In
    contrast, an older population would have heating only from AGN
    feedback and supernovae.
  
    Quantitatively $\rs\sim v_w^{-2}$, which implies $\Mdot\sim
    v_w^{-3.8 (-2.4)}$ for core (cusp galaxies). However, $\Mdot$ may
    increase more rapidly for small $v_w$ for two reasons. (1) When
    $v_w$ becomes comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion, the
    gas inside of the break radius inside of the break radius inside
    of the stellar density profile is bound and cannot move
    outflow. (2) For $v_w\simeq200 $ km/s the gas may become thermally
    unstable and there may be a cycle of alternating high and low
    accretion rates onto the BH as described in...{\bf AG: Fill in} 

  \item We find that galaxies with $\Mbh\gsim 10^6 \Msun$ and
    $\Mbh\lsim 10^8$ following average star formation histories
    measured in cosmological simulations \citep{MosterNaab+:2013a}
    have sufficient recent star formation to have an effective
    $v_w\simeq 1000$ km/s. $\eddr \propto \Mbh^{\alpha}$ with
    $\alpha\lsim 0.5 \, (0.8)$ for core (cusp) galaxies This is in
    tension observations of nuclear X-ray luminosity which suggest
    that $\eddr$ increases towards smaller $\Mbh$
    \citep{Miller+15}. However, it is important to note that the
    inflow rate on large scales (which we calculate) may differ from
    the actual accretion rate as outflows could occur on small
    scales. The outflow rate would depend on the angular momentum of
    the infalling gas and thus the angular momentum of stars in the
    nucleus. The in turn would vary systematically with $\Mbh$.

    For $\Mbh\gsim 10^8 \Msun$, the flow from stellar winds onto the
    BH is more susceptible to thermal instability due to the lower
    effective wind velocity $v_w$. 
  \item We expect scatter in nuclear x-ray luminosities at
    fixed $\Mbh$ from (1) stochastic variation in star formation
    history from galaxy to galaxy (2) Variations in small scale outflow
    rates due to variations between galactic nuclear angular
    momenta. {\bf AG: some more explanation of why 1 might not show up
    in Pellegrini...}
    These variations alone could explain much of the 2-4 orders of
    magnitude of scatter of nuclear x-ray luminosity at fixed $\Mbh$ 
    in the samples of \citet{Miller+15} and \citet{Pellegrini:2010a}.
    
    It is also possible that many of the galaxies in the
    \citet{Miller+15} are accreting in a non-steady fashion and this
    scatter arises from cyclic variation in accretion rate. In fact it
    that a population of cyclically accreting with $\Mbh\gsim 10^{8}
    \Msun$ coexists with a population of smaller, steadily accreting
    black holes (e.g. the upper limits in \citet{Miller+15}).  This
    calls into question the use of simple extrapolations of power-law
    fits to the $L_{\rm X}(M_{\bullet}$) relationship to low $M_{\bullet}$
    to constrain the occupation fraction of black holes in low mass
    galaxies (\citealt{Miller+15}).
  \item Low mass AGN have growth times comparable to the Hubble time
    (\citet{Heckman+04}). We have shown that this would require accretion
    rates not consistent with steady-state thermally stable accretion
    of stellar wind material, and is driven by an external supply of gas.
  \item We compare the $\Mdot$ for each of our solution to the one
    calculated from the Bondi formula. We find that they agree to
    within a factor of order unity. This is because in our model the
    accretion rate is determined by the flow properties at the
    stagnation radius, $\rs$, which is within a factor of a few of the
    Bondi radius $\rb$. Thus, use of the Bondi formula is a
    good approximation.
    \end{enumerate}
   
    Overall we conclude that for values of $\Mbh\lsim 10^{8} \Msun$,
    the observed nuclear x-ray luminosities in quiescent, early type
    galaxies could be understood as coming from thermally stable
    steady-state accretion of stellar winds shed in the galactic
    nucleus.  However, we would like to draw attention to the
    following limitations of our model

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Overall the accretion rate onto the central SMBH will be strongly
    tied to the properties of the stellar population (e.g. age) within
    the sphere of influence of the black hole. Thus, our model cannot
    say anything definitive about the mode accretion for individual
    galaxies which may have significant variations about our assumed
    average star formation histories.
    \item Also, the star formation history of bulges may (and probably
      does) systematically differ from the average star formation
      history for galaxies as a whole.
    \item Furthermore, there could be a radial gradient in the star
      formation history within a given bulge... 
    \end{enumerate}
