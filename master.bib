	Abstract = {We derive the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using a sample of 132 SNe Ia, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS2) among 66 000 galaxies with spectral-based star formation histories (SFHs). To recover the best-fitting DTD, the SFH of every individual galaxy is compared, using Poisson statistics, to the number of SNe that it hosted (zero or one), based on the method introduced in Maoz et al. This SN sample differs from the SDSS2 SN Ia sample analysed by Brandt et al., using a related, but different, DTD recovery method. Furthermore, we use a simulation-based SN detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number of important corrections to the galaxy SFHs and SN Ia visibility times. The DTD that we find has 4sigma detections in all three of its time bins: prompt (tau < 0.42 Gyr), intermediate (0.42 < tau < 2.4 Gyr) and delayed (tau > 2.4 Gyr), indicating a continuous DTD, and it is among the most accurate and precise among recent DTD reconstructions. The best-fitting power-law form to the recovered DTD is t-1.07 $\pm$ 0.07, consistent with generic ˜t-1 predictions of SN Ia progenitor models based on the gravitational-wave-induced mergers of binary white dwarfs. The time-integrated number of SNe Ia per formed stellar mass is NSN/M = 0.00130 $\pm$ 0.00015  M&sun;-1, or about 4 per cent of the stars formed with initial masses in the 3 - 8 M&sun; range. This is lower than, but largely consistent with, several recent DTD estimates based on SN rates in galaxy clusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher than, but consistent with NSN/M estimated by comparing volumetric SN Ia rates to cosmic SFH.},

@article{EmsellemCappellari+:2007a,
	Abstract = {Two-dimensional stellar kinematics of 48 representative elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define a new parameter , which involves luminosity-weighted averages over the full two-dimensional kinematic field as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators, depending on whether they have lambdaR values within their effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. Slow and fast rotators are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. Fast rotators tend to be relatively low-luminosity galaxies with MB >~ -20.5. Slow rotators tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. Three slow rotators of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other slow rotators (besides the atypical case of NGC 4550) contain a large kpc-scale kinematically decoupled core (KDC). All fast rotators (except one galaxy with well-known irregular shells) show well-aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most slow rotators which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. These results are supported by a supplement of 18 additional early-type galaxies observed with SAURON. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that fast and slow rotators are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of fast rotators, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. Detailed numerical simulations in a cosmological context are required to understand how to form large-scale KDCs within slow rotators, and more generally to explain the distribution of lambdaR values within early-type galaxies and the distinction between fast and slow rotators.},

	Abstract = {Rotation and velocity dispersion data are presented for 17 elliptical galaxies for which no or only insufficient measurements were available. Using data from the literature, the relation between velocity anisotropies and isophote shapes in elliptical galaxies is investigated. It is found that elliptical galaxies most likely can be separated into two classes. Objects having peaked isophotes (indicating weak disk components) are in general consistent with being rotationally flattened, suggesting that these objects are similar to S0 galaxies. In contrast, elliptical galaxies with box-shaped isophotes frequently owe their shape to anisotropies in their velocity dispersion and most likely are triaxial.},

	Abstract = {Extensive kinematical studies have shown that elliptical galaxies exhibit a wide variety of dynamical properties. There is evidence that the dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies depend upon their luminosity. In connection with the present investigation, major axis spectra have been obtained. Rotation and velocity dispersion profiles have been derived for four elliptical galaxies NGC 3379, NGC 4839, NGC 4889 and NGC 6909, and for the probable S0 galaxy NGC 584. NGC 3379 is consistent with being a rotationally-flattened isotropic-dispersion constant M/L oblate spheroid. While NGC 584 is classified E/S0, it is most likely an S0. If so, it, along with NGC 128 and NGC 4595, has the most luminous bulges for which kinematical data are available. For NGC 4839 and NGC 4889, two of the three brightest galaxies in Coma, virtually no rotation is found.},

@article{RussellMcNamara+:2013a,
	Abstract = {We examine unresolved nuclear X-ray sources in 57 brightest cluster galaxies to study the relationship between nuclear X-ray emission and accretion on to supermassive black holes. The majority of the clusters in our sample have prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres, which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate on to the supermassive black holes over the past several hundred Myr. We find that roughly half of the sample have detectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated with average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing accretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts, in the last ˜107 yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear X-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as the mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet power when the mean accretion rate rises above a few per cent of the Eddington rate, or a power output of {˜ }10^{45} {erg s^{-1}}, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on time-scales of 6 months to 10 years. If variability at this level is a common phenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship between mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity. We find no significant change in the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable objects. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is consistent with emission from either a jet, an advection-dominated accretion flow, or a combination of the two, although other origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gas or nearly spherical inflows of hot keV gas. For a subset of 13 nearby systems in our sample, we re-examine the relationship between the jet power and the Bondi accretion rate. The results indicate weaker evidence for a trend between Bondi accretion and jet power, due to uncertainties in the cavity volumes and gas densities at the Bondi radius. We suggest that cold gas fuelling could be a likely source of accretion power in these objects; however, we cannot rule out Bondi accretion, which could play a significant role in low-power jets.},

@article{FaberTremaine+:1997a,
	Abstract = {We analyze Hubble Space Telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61 elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hereafter "hot" galaxies). The profiles are parameterized by break radius rbetaand break surface brightness 1beta These are combined with central velocity dispersions, total luminosities, rotation velocities, and isophote shapes to explore correlations among central and global properties. Luminous hot galaxies (Mv<-22) have cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r≈rbeta to shallow inner profiles I∝r-gamma with gamma<=0.3. Break radii and core luminosities for these objects are approximately proportional to effective radii and total luminosities. Scaling relations are presented for several core parameters as a function of total luminosity. Cores follow a fundamental plane that parallels the global fundamental plane for hot galaxies but is 30% thicker. Some of this extra thickness may be due to the effect of massive black holes (BHs) on central velocity dispersions. Faint hot galaxies (Mv>-20.5) show steep, largely featureless power-law profiles that lack cores. Measured values of rb and b for these galaxies are limits only. At a limiting radius of 10 pc, the centers of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass and luminosity than the cores of large galaxies. At intermediate magnitudes (-22<Mv<-20.5), core and power-law galaxies coexist, and there is a range in rbeta at a given luminosity of at least two orders of magnitude.  Here, central properties correlate strongly with global rotation and shape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law galaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. A search for inner disks was conducted to test a claim in the literature, based on a smaller sample, that power laws originate from edge-on stellar disks. We find only limited evidence for such disks and believe that the difference between core and power-law profiles reflects a real difference in the spatial distribution of the luminous spheroidal component of the galaxy. The dense power-law centers of disky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-rich mergers. The parallel proposition, that cores are the by-products of gas-free stellar mergers, is less compelling for at least two reasons: (1) dissipationless hierarchical clustering does not appear to produce core profiles like those seen; (2) core galaxies accrete small, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in their low-density cores if the satellites survived and sank to the center (whether the satellites survive is still an open question). An alternative model for core formation involves the orbital decay of massive BHs that are accreted in mergers: the decaying BHs may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any exists and scouring out a core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times the stellar mass yields cores in fair agreement with observed cores and is consistent with the energetics of AGNs and the kinematic detection of BHs in nearby galaxies. An unresolved issue is why power-law galaxies also do not have cores if this process operates in all hot galaxies.},

@article{FujitaKawakatu+:2014a,
	Abstract = {(Abridged) We propose a new method to estimate the Bondi (hot gas) accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of elliptical galaxies. It can be applied even if the Bondi radius is not well-resolved in X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple assumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in nearly a hydrostatic equilibrium in a gravitational potential, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy centre is close to the virial temperature of the galaxy. We apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in nearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest cluster galaxies; BCGs). We find a strong correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets associated with the SMBHs. For most galaxies, the accretion rates are large enough to account for the jet powers. Our results indicate that hot gas in the elliptical galaxies directly controls the feedback from the active galactic nuclei (AGN), which leads to a stable heating of the cluster cool cores. We also find that more massive SMBHs in BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates. This may explain the hyper masses (~10^10 Msun) of some of the SMBHs. Comparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of the AGN suggests that the AGN in the BCGs are extremely radiatively inefficient compared with X-ray binaries in the Milky Way. Lastly, we find a tight correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of cool cores. Their relation is nearly linear and the power generated by the Bondi accretion is large enough to compensate the radiative cooling of the cool cores. The results of this study demonstrate that the AGN feedback associated with Bondi accretion is essential to suppress cooling flows in clusters.},

@article{NaimanSoares-Furtado+:2013a,
	Abstract = {We employ hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the low levels of gas and dust in globular clusters. Our models examine the competing effects of mass supply from the evolved stellar population and energy injection from the main sequence stellar members for globular clusters 47 Tucanae, M15, NGC 6440, and NGC 6752. Disregarding all other gas evacuation processes, we find that the energy output from the main sequence stellar population alone is capable of effectively clearing the evolved stellar ejecta and producing intracluster gas densities consistent with current observational constraints. This result distinguishes a viable ubiquitous gas and dust evacuation mechanism for globular clusters. In addition, we extend our analysis to probe the efficiency of pulsar wind feedback in globular clusters. The detection of intracluster ionized gas in cluster 47 Tucanae allows us to place particularly strict limits on pulsar wind thermalization efficiency, which must be extremely low in the cluster's core in order to be in accordance with the observed density constraints.},

	Abstract = {We compute rates of tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, using downwardly revised black hole masses from the MBH-sigma relation. In galaxies with steep nuclear density profiles, which dominate the overall event rate, the disruption frequency varies inversely with assumed black hole mass. We compute a total rate for nondwarf galaxies of ~10-5 yr-1 Mpc-3, about a factor of 10 higher than in earlier studies. Disruption rates are predicted to be highest in nucleated dwarf galaxies, assuming that such galaxies contain black holes. Monitoring of a rich galaxy cluster for a few years could rule out the existence of intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies.},

@article{ShcherbakovWong+:2014a,
	Abstract = {Based on the dynamical black hole (BH) mass estimates, NGC 3115 hosts the closest billion solar mass BH. Deep studies of the center revealed a very underluminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) immersed in an old massive nuclear star cluster. Recent 1 Ms Chandra X-ray visionary project observations of the NGC 3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous gas, which fuels the AGN. In this paper we connect the processes in the nuclear star cluster with the feeding of the supermassive BH. We model the hot gas flow sustained by the injection of matter and energy from the stars and supernova explosions. We incorporate electron heat conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, the gravitational pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and Coulomb collisions. Fitting simulated X-ray emission to the spatially and spectrally resolved observed data, we find the best-fitting solutions with chi2/dof = 1.00 for dof = 236 both with and without conduction. The radial modeling favors a low BH mass <1.3 × 109 M &sun;. The best-fitting supernova rate and the best-fitting mass injection rate are consistent with their expected values. The stagnation point is at r st <~ 1'', so that most of the gas, including the gas at a Bondi radius rB = 2''-4'', outflows from the region. We put an upper limit on the accretion rate at 2 × 10-3 M &sun; yr-1. We find a shallow density profile nvpropr -beta with beta ≈ 1 over a large dynamic range. This density profile is determined in the feeding region 0.''5-10'' as an interplay of four processes and effects: (1) the radius-dependent mass injection, (2) the effect of the galactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion flow onset at r <~ 1'', and (4) the outflow at r >~ 1''. The gas temperature is close to the virial temperature Tv at any radius.},

@article{De-ColleGuillochon+:2012a,
	Abstract = {We examine the consequences of a model in which relativistic jets can be triggered in quiescent massive black holes when a geometrically thick and hot accretion disk forms as a result of the tidal disruption of a star. To estimate the power, thrust, and lifetime of the jet, we use the mass accretion history onto the black hole as calculated by detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal disruption of stars. We go on to determine the states of the interstellar medium in various types of quiescent galactic nuclei, and describe how this external matter can affect jets propagating through it. We use this information, together with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the structure of the relativistic flow, to study the dynamics of the jet, the propagation of which is regulated by the density stratification of the environment and by its injection history. The breaking of symmetry involved in transitioning from one to two dimensions is crucial and leads to qualitatively new phenomena. At early times, as the jet power increases, the high pressure of the cocoon collimates the jet, increasing its shock velocity as compared to that of spherical models. We show that small velocity gradients, induced near or at the source, steepen into internal shocks and provide a source of free energy for particle acceleration and radiation along the jet's channel. The jets terminate at a working surface where they interact strongly with the surrounding medium through a combination of shock waves and instabilities; a continuous flow of relativistic fluid emanating from the nucleus supplies this region with mass, momentum, and energy. Information about the t -5/3 decrease in power supply propagates within the jet at the internal sound speed. As a result, the internal energy at the jet head continues to accumulate until long after the peak feeding rate is reached. An appreciable time delay is thus expected between peaks in the short-wavelength radiation emanating near the jet's origin and the long-wavelength emission produced at the head of the jet. Many of the observed properties of the Swift 1644+57/GRB 110328A event can be understood as resulting from accretion onto and jets driven by a 106 M &sun; central mass black hole following the disruption of a sun-like star. With the inclusion of a stochastic contribution to the luminosity due to variations in the feeding rate driven by instabilities near the tidal radius, we find that our model can explain the X-ray light curve without invoking a rarely occurring deep encounter. In conjunction with the number density of black holes in the local universe, we hypothesize that the conditions required to produce the Swift event are not anomalous, but are in fact representative of the jet-driven flare population arising from tidal disruptions.},

	Abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray observations of nine nearby, X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlation exists between the Bondi accretion rates calculated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles and estimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets. The jet powers, which are inferred from the energies and time-scales required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion rates using a power-law model of the form log(PBondi/1043ergs-1) = A + Blog(Pjet/1043ergs-1), with A = 0.65 +/- 0.16 and B = 0.77 +/- 0.20. Our results show that a significant fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the Bondi accretion radius (2.2+1.0-0.7 per cent, for Pjet = 1043ergs-1) eventually emerges in the relativistic jets. The data also hint that this fraction may rise slightly with increasing jet power. Our results have significant implications for studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. The observed tight correlation suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems, despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas. The similarity of the PBondi and Pjet values argues that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes, where the jets are presumably formed. The tight correlation between PBondi and Pjet also suggests that the accretion flows are approximately stable over time-scales of a few million years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

	Abstract = {Distinct seed formation mechanisms are imprinted upon the fraction of dwarf galaxies currently containing a central supermassive black hole. Seeding by Pop III remnants is expected to produce a higher occupation fraction than is generated with direct gas collapse precursors. Chandra observations of nearby early-type galaxies can directly detect even low-level supermassive black hole activity, and the active fraction immediately provides a firm lower limit to the occupation fraction. Here, we use the volume-limited AMUSE surveys of ~200 optically-selected early-type galaxies to characterize simultaneously, for the first time, the occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear X-ray luminosity with stellar mass, accounting for intrinsic scatter, measurement uncertainties, and X-ray limits. For early-type galaxies with log(M_star/M_sun)<10, we obtain a lower limit to the occupation fraction of >20% (at 95% confidence), but full occupation cannot be excluded. The preferred dependence of log(L_X) upon log(M_star) has a slope of about 0.7-0.8, consistent with the "downsizing" trend previously identified from the AMUSE dataset, and a uniform Eddington efficiency is disfavored at ~2 sigma. We provide guidelines for the future precision with which these parameters may be refined with larger or more sensitive samples.},

	Abstract = {Angular momentum loss to circumbinary gas provides a possible mechanism for overcoming the ``last parsec'' problem and allowing the most massive black hole binaries formed from galactic mergers to coalesce. Here we show that if gas disks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower mass binaries detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), then there may be a purely gravitational wave signature of the role of gas in the form of a small but finite eccentricity just prior to merger. Numerical simulations suggest that eccentricity, excited by the interaction between the binary and surrounding gas disk, is only partially damped during the final phase of gravitational radiation-driven inspiral. We estimate a typical eccentricity at 1 week prior to coalescence of e\~{}0.01. Higher terminal eccentricities, which can approach e=0.1, are possible if the binary has an extreme mass ratio. The detection of even a small eccentricity prior to merger by LISA provides a possible discriminant 
between gas-driven inspirals and those effected by stellar processes.},

	Abstract = {The existing theory of density wave excitation in two-dimensional gaseous disks by imposed gravitational potentials makes approximations which prevent a direct analytical description of the shifts in effective positions of Lindblad resonances with respect to radii satisfying orbital commensurability requirement, and of the so-called torque cutoff arising at large azimuthal numbers m of the perturbing potential's pattern. Both phenomena are related to the azimuthal forces acting on gas, neglected in the WKB approximation commonly used in the past. We extend previous theories of Lindblad resonance wherever necessary for a consistent analytical treatment of the problem, particularly for large m. Our analytical approach applies to wave excitation at Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating, two-dimensional gas layers (vertically averaged disks or fundamental vertical mode of three-dimensional disks). It explicitly includes the resonance shifts and torque cutoffs. The theory is valid for small 
perturbing potentials of arbitrary form (including highly localized potentials, e.g., point-mass potential, spiral potential with arbitrary pitch angle, etc.). We present a torque formula generalizing the standard Goldreich-Tremaine formula. Especially useful in the problem of disk-satellite interaction, the torque formula provides insight into the origin of the torque cutoff at m larger than the radius to thickness ratio of the disk. Qualitatively, the cutoff is an effect of: (i) a mild (power-law) intrinsic torque cutoff, independent of the radial profile of the imposed potential, and (ii) a sharp (exponential) cutoff due to shifts in effective resonance location away from the perturber. For m → ∞ the latter effect causes the increasingly localized potential to decouple spatially from the wave generation region. A disk annulus surrounding the corotation radius of every m-armed potential, of width comparable with twice the vertical disk scale height, remains evanescent for waves excited by that harmonic 
and does not contribute significantly to the total torque between the perturber and the disk. We discuss the role of gas viscosity, self-gravity, and the applicability of a two-dimensional analysis to Lindblad resonances in three-dimensional disks.},

	Abstract = {Using a generalized torque formula for Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating gaseous disks we study the interaction of disks with small, embedded bodies (not able to open a gap). For satellites on circular orbits, the generalized torque formula reproduces exactly the torque cutoff occurring at high azimuthal number m of the potential harmonics, originally found seminumerically by Goldreich \{\&\} Tremaine (1980) in the shearing coordinates representation. The cutoff is attributable to the shift in the effective Lindblad resonance position with respect to the nominal resonant radius given by the usual period commensurabilty requirement. We apply the theory to the problem of orbital eccentricity evolution of embedded satellites. We relax some of the assumptions implicit in previous calculations related to this problem, most importantly that of a spatially smooth perturbing potential. We treat the co-orbital and the external Lindblad resonances within a unified formalism. We calculate the 
total rate of eccentricity damping due to co-orbital resonances and the excitation due to external resonances, the former exceeding the latter by a factor roughly equal to 3, independent of the method of averaging over the vertical disk structure. In application to a solar nebula with embedded planetesimals, the timescales of eccentricity damping for a wide range of planetesimal masses are much shorter than those corresponding to either gas drag, planetesimal growth, or nebular lifetime, and thus relevant to the scenarios of planetary system formation. In application to large (radius > 10 m) particles in Saturn's rings we estimate that the eccentricity is damped on the orbital timescale},

	Abstract = {The mildly nonlinear response of a fluid disk with pressure, viscosity, and self-gravity to spiral stellar forcing is considered as a model of the interstellar medium in spiral galaxies. Nonlinear effects are analyzed through a quasi-linear flow analysis ordered by successive powers of a dimensionless spiral perturbing force, which is the ratio of imposed nonaxisymmetric gravitational to axisymmetric gravitational forces. Waves with mn arms are launched from a position where the wavenumber of a free wave matches n times the wavenumber of the spiral forcing. The launched short wave in the gas is an interarm feature that is more tightly wrapped than the stellar wave. The gas wave extracts energy and angular momentum from the stellar wave, causing it to damp. The application of the results to the stellar disk alone reveals even stronger damping, as stars undergo Landau damping of the short wave. For parameters in M81, damping times are less than 10 exp 9 yr.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the gravitational interaction of a generally eccentric binary star system with circumbinary and circumstellar gaseous disks. The disks are assumed to be coplanar with the binary, geometrically thin, and primarily governed by gas pressure and (turbulent) viscosity but not self-gravity. Both ordinary and eccentric Lindblad resonances are primarily responsible for truncating the disks in binaries with arbitrary eccentricity and nonextreme mass ratio. Starting from a smooth disk configuration, after the gravitational field of the binary truncates the disk on the dynamical timescale, a quasi-equilibrium is achieved, in which the resonant and viscous torques balance each other and any changes in the structure of the disk (e.g., due to global viscous evolution) occur slowly, preserving the average size of the gap. We analytically compute the approximate sizes of disks (or disk gaps) as a function of binary mass ratio and eccentricity in this quasi-equilibrium. Comparing the gap sizes with 
results of direct simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we obtain a good agreement. As a by-product of the computations, we verify that standard SPH codes can adequately represent the dynamics of disks with moderate viscosity, Reynolds number R approximately 103. For typical viscous disk parameters, and with a denoting the binary semimajor axis, the inner edge location of a circumbinary disk varies from 1.8a to 2.6a with binary eccentricity increasing from 0 to 0.25. For eccentricities 0 less than e less than 0.75, the minimum separation between a component star and the circumbinary disk inner edge is greater than a. Our calculations are relevant, among others, to protobinary stars and the recently discovered T Tau pre-main-sequence binaries. We briefly examine the case of a pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary GW Ori and conclude that circumbinary disk truncation to the size required by one proposed spectroscopic model cannot be due to Linblad resonances, even if the disk is 
nonviscous.},

@article{BarnesHernquist:1996a,
	Abstract = {In mergers of disk galaxies, gas plays a role quite out of proportion to its relatively modest contribution to the total mass. To study this behavior, we have included gasdynamics in self-consistent simulations of collisions between equal-mass disk galaxies. The large-scale dynamics of bridge- and tail-making, orbit decay, and merging are not much altered by the inclusion of a gaseous component. However, tidal forces during encounters cause otherwise stable disks to develop bars, and the gas in such barred disks, subjected to strong gravitational torques, flows toward the central regions where it may fuel the kiloparsec-scale starbursts seen in some interacting disk systems. Similar torques on the gas during the final stages of a collision yield massive gas concentrations in the cores of merger remnants, which may be plausibly identified with the molecular complexes seen in objects such as NGC 520 and Arp 220. This result appears insensitive to the detailed microphysics of the gas, provided that 
radiative cooling is permitted. The inflowing gas can dramatically alter the stellar morphology of a merger remnant, apparently by deepening the potential well and thereby changing the boundaries between the major orbital families.},

	Abstract = {Binary supermassive black holes (SBHs) form naturally in galaxy mergers, but their long-term evolution is uncertain. In spherical galaxies, N-body simulations show that binary evolution stalls at separations much too large for significant emission of gravitational waves (the ``final-parsec problem''). Here we follow the long-term evolution of a massive binary in more realistic, triaxial and rotating galaxy models with particle numbers as high as 106. We find that the binary does not stall. The binary hardening rates that we observe are sufficient to allow complete coalescence of binary SBHs in 10 Gyr or less, even in the absence of collisional loss-cone refilling or gasdynamical torques, thus providing a potential solution to the final-parsec problem.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the formation and evolution of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in rotating galactic nuclei, focusing on the role of stellar dynamics. We present the first N-body simulations that follow the evolution of the SMBHs from kiloparsec separations all the way to their final relativistic coalescence, and that can robustly be scaled to real galaxies. The N-body code includes post-Newtonian (P N) corrections to the binary equations of motion up to order 2.5; we show that the evolution of the massive binary is only correctly reproduced if the conservative 1 P N and 2 P N terms are included. The orbital eccentricities of the massive binaries in our simulations are often found to remain large until shortly before coalescence. This directly affects not only their orbital evolution rates, but has important consequences as well for the gravitational waveforms emitted during the relativistic inspiral. We estimate gravitational wave amplitudes when the frequencies fall inside the band of 
the (planned) Laser Interferometer Space Antennae (LISA). We find significant contributions---well above the LISA sensitivity curve---from the higher-order harmonics.},

	Abstract = {We fit general relativistic, geometrically thin accretion disk models with non-LTE atmospheres to near simultaneous multiwavelength data of 3C\~{}273, extending from the optical to the far ultraviolet. Our model fits show no flux discontinuity associated with a hydrogen Lyman edge, but they do exhibit a spectral break which qualitatively resembles that seen in the data. This break arises from relativistic smearing of Lyman emission edges which are produced locally at tens of gravitational radii in the disk. We discuss the possible effects of metal line blanketing on the model spectra, as well as the substantial Comptonization required to explain the observed soft X-ray excess. Our best fit accretion disk model underpredicts the near ultraviolet emission in this source, and also has an optical spectrum which is too red. We discuss some of the remaining physical uncertainties, and suggest in particular that an extension of our models to the slim disk regime and/or including nonzero magnetic torques 
across the innermost stable circular orbit may help resolve these discrepancies.},

	Abstract = {Relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that contain compact objects. They transport large amounts of energy to large distances from the source and their interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effect on the evolution of the system. The propagation of the jet is characterized by the formation of a shocked "head" at the front of the jet which dissipates the jet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it. We present here a self-consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution of the jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. We show that the critical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system is the dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-mass energy density of the ambient medium. This parameter, together with the jet's injection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon or not. The model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized jets on all scales and may be used to determine the conditions in active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets as well as in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or microquasars. It shows that AGN and microquasar jets are hydrodynamically collimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium, while GRB jets can be collimated only inside a star and become uncollimated once they break out.},

	Abstract = {We report Chandra observations of a double X-ray source in the z = 0.1569 galaxy SDSS J171544.05+600835.7. The galaxy was initially identified as a dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidate based on the double-peaked [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission lines, with a line-of-sight velocity separation of 350 km s-1, in its Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum. We used the Kast Spectrograph at Lick Observatory to obtain two long-slit spectra of the galaxy at two different position angles, which reveal that the two Type 2 AGN emission components have not only a velocity offset, but also a projected spatial offset of 1.9 h -1 70 kpc on the sky. Chandra/ACIS observations of two X-ray sources with the same spatial offset and orientation as the optical emission suggest that the galaxy most likely contains Compton-thick dual AGNs, although the observations could also be explained by AGN jets. Deeper X-ray observations that reveal Fe K lines, if present, would distinguish between the two scenarios. The 
observations of a double X-ray source in SDSS J171544.05+600835.7 are a proof of concept for a new, systematic detection method that selects promising dual AGN candidates from ground-based spectroscopy that exhibits both velocity and spatial offsets in the AGN emission features.},

	Abstract = {Finding electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of future gravitational wave (GW) sources would bring rich scientific benefits. A promising possibility, in the case of the coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), is that the prompt emission from merger-induced disturbances in a supersonic circumbinary disc may be detectable. We follow the post-merger evolution of a thin, zero-viscosity circumbinary gas disc with two-dimensional simulations, using the hydrodynamic code FLASH. We analyse perturbations arising from the 530 km s-1 recoil of a 106Msolar binary, oriented in the plane of the disc, assuming either a non-radiative gamma-law or a pseudo-isothermal equation of state for the gas. We find that a single-armed spiral shock wave forms and propagates outwards, sweeping up \~{}40 per cent of the mass of the disc. The morphology and evolution of the perturbations agrees well with those of caustics predicted to occur in a collisionless disc. Assuming that the disc radiates nearly 
instantaneously to maintain a constant temperature, we estimate the amount of dissipation and corresponding post-merger light curve. The luminosity rises steadily on the time-scale of months, and reaches few √\'{o}1043 ergs-1, corresponding to \~{}10 per cent of the Eddington luminosity of the central SMBHB. We also analyse the case in which gravitational wave emission results in a 5 per cent mass loss in the merger remnant. The mass loss reduces the shock overdensities and the overall luminosity of the disc by \~{}15-20 per cent, without any other major effects on the spiral shock pattern.},

	Abstract = {We study the efficiency and dynamics of supermassive black hole binary mergers driven by angular momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of binaries embedded within geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated by disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good agreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e >\~{} 0.35. Accretion on to the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital frequency. Scaling our results, 
we analytically estimate the maximum rate of binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occurring within the surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 105 <\~{} M <\~{} 108Msolar we find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a \~{} 0.01-0.1pc, in the regime where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time-scale is shorter than the Hubble time for M <\~{} 107Msolar. This implies that gas discs could commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole mergers, and that a significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few hundredths of a parsec, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas disc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally supported nuclear disc of mass Mdisc = 108Msolar is explored using N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Gas and star particles are copresent in the disc. Described by a Mestel profile, the disc has a vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by stellar velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of mass 4 × 106Msolar is placed at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric corotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two black holes form a close binary in \~{}10 Myr. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail 
the gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can lead to the formation of two small Keplerian discs, weighing \~{}2per cent of the black hole mass, and of size \~{}0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double active galactic nucleus activity is expected to occur on an estimated time-scale of <\~{}10 Myr, comparable to the inspiral time-scale. The double nuclear point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution will have typical separations of <\~{}10 pc.},

@article{EscalaLarson+:2005b,
	Abstract = {Using high-resolution SPH numerical simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the in-spiral and merger of a massive black hole binary. This study is motivated by the very massive nuclear gas disks observed in the central regions of merging galaxies. Here we present results that expand on the treatment in a previous work by studying models in which the gas is in a disk. We run a variety of models, ranging from simulations with a relatively smooth gas disk to cases in which the gas has a more clumpy spatial distribution. We also vary the inclination angle between the plane of the binary and the plane of the disk, and the mass ratio between the MBHs and the gaseous disk. We find that, as in our previous work, in the early evolution of the system the binary separation diminishes mainly due to dynamical friction exerted by the background gas, and in the later stages the gaseous medium responds by forming an ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary axis. This offset 
produces a gravitational torque on the binary that causes continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce the separation to distances at which gravitational radiation is efficient. The main difference is that between these two regimes we now find a new transition regime that was not apparent in our previous paper, in which the evolution is temporarily slowed down when neither of these mechanisms is fully effective. In the variety of simulations that we perform, we find that the coalescence timescale for the MBH binary varies between 5×106 and 2.5×107 yr for typical ULIRGs. For MBHs that satisfy the observed ``m-$\sigma$c'' relation, our simulations suggest that in a merger of galaxies that have at least 1\% of their total mass in gas, the MBHs will coalesce soon after the galaxies merge.},

	Abstract = {We report on the completion of the first version of a new-generation simulation code, FLASH. The FLASH code solves the fully compressible, reactive hydrodynamic equations and allows for the use of adaptive mesh refinement. It also contains state-of-the-art modules for the equations of state and thermonuclear reaction networks. The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.},

The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found that the external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances, that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the corotation 
resonance. The behavior of particle disks is briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

It is shown that the angular momentum and energy transfer at Lindblad resonances tends to increase the satellite's orbit to lowest order in eccentricity, whereas the transfer at corotation resonances tends to decrease it. The results are applied to the interaction between Jupiter and the protoplanetary disk.

@article{Goodman:2003a,
	Abstract = {The outer parts of standard steady-state accretion discs around quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are prone to self-gravity, and they might be expected to fragment into stars rather than feed the central black hole. Possible solutions to this well-known problem are examined with an emphasis on general dynamic constraints. Irradiation by the QSO is insufficient for stability even if the outer disc is strongly warped. Marginal local gravitational instability enhances viscous transport but extends the stable regions only modestly. Compton cooling in the observed QSO radiation field rules out hot thick discs unless the local accretion rate is vastly super-Eddington. The formation of stars or stellar-mass black holes, and the release of energy in these objects by fusion or accretion, may help to stabilize the remaining gas in an otherwise standard disc. But at fixed mass accretion rate, the energy inputs required for stability increase with radius; beyond a parsec, they approach the total QSO luminosity 
and are probably unsustainable by stars. Magnetic torques from a wind or corona, and gravitational torques from bars or global spirals, may increase the accretion speed and reduce the density of the disc. But dynamical arguments suggest that the accretion speed is at most sonic, so that instability still sets in beyond about a parsec. Alternatively, the QSO could be fed by stellar collisions in a very dense stellar cluster, but the velocity dispersion would have to be much higher than observed in nearby galactic nuclei containing quiescent black holes. In view of these difficulties, we suggest that QSO discs do not extend beyond a thousand Schwarzschild radii or so. Then they must be frequently replenished with gas of small specific angular momentum.},

	Abstract = {To examine the role of the host galaxy structure in fueling nuclear activity, we estimated gas flow rates from several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc for seven nearby spiral galaxies, selected from the NUclei of GAlaxies sample. We calculated gravitational torques from near-infrared images and determined gas in/out-flow rates as a function of radius and location within the galactic disks, based on high angular resolution interferometric observations of molecular (CO using Plateau de Bure interferometer) and atomic (H I using the Very Large Array) gas. The results are compared with kinematic evidence for radial gas flows and the dynamical state of the galaxies (via resonances) derived from several different methods. We show that gravitational torques are very efficient at transporting gas from the outer disk all the way into the galaxies centers at \~{}100 pc; previously assumed dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the corotation resonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by 
gravitational torque induced gas flows from other nonaxisymmetric structures. The resulting rates of gas mass inflow range from 0.01 to 50 M sun yr-1 and are larger for the galaxy center than for the outer disk. Our gas flow maps show the action of nested bars within larger bars for three galaxies. Noncircular streaming motions found in the kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer disk and appear to correlate only loosely with the in/out-flow rates as a function of radius. We demonstrate that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems that undergo strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation periods (e.g., 5 × 108 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to the effectiveness of gravitational torques in redistributing the cold galactic gas.},

	Abstract = {We study the number and interaction rates of supermassive black holes in galactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation in which the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. In bright ellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binary black hole is large. Central binaries must therefore merge in less than a Hubble time - otherwise there will be too much scatter in the M*-$\sigma$* relation and too many off-centre galactic nuclei. We propose that binary black holes are able to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger QSO activity in galaxies. If this is the case, less than 10 per cent of faint ellipticals and 40 per cent of bright ellipticals are predicted to harbour binary black holes with near equal masses at their centres. This binary may be ejected away from the centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 per cent of the most luminous ellipticals. The number of low-mass black holes that 
can interact with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxy luminosity. In most faint ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre of the galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminous ellipticals, an average of 10 low-mass black holes interact with the central supermassive object after this time. It is expected that stars will be ejected from galaxy cores as these low mass ratio binaries harden. Multiple black holes in galactic bulges thus provide a natural explanation for the strong systematic trends in the observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a function of luminosity.},

	Abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic nuclei are thought to be a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for the circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital decay of SMBHBs with a range of total masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is generically in the stalled "secondary-dominated" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of a fiducial time of 107 yr at orbital periods between days lsimt orblsim yr, and we argue that they may be sufficiently common to be detectable, provided they are luminous during these stages. A dedicated optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance obeys the scaling N var vprop t $\alpha$ var within a range of periods around t var\~{} tens of weeks. 
SMBHBs with M lsim 107 M sun, with 0.5 lsim $\alpha$ lsim 1.5, would probe the physics of viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass binaries, with $\alpha$ = 8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The lowest-mass SMBHBs (M lsim 105-6 M sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short orbital periods, when they are already in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are negligible in the last few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved background due to near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss modest constraints on the SMBHB population already available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.},

In the simulations we consider a triple-disk system composing of two accretion disks around BHs and one circumbinary disk surrounding the two. The circumbinary disk works as a mass reservoir. We confirm that a non-axisymmetric accretion disk is formed around each BH. The X-ray luminosity of the secondary BH exhibits the double peaks every binary orbit, whereas that of the primary BH shows a single peak. Such properties can not be seen in the case of equal mass BBHs and therefore provide a potentially important observational signature of supermassive BBHs with low mass ratios.},

@article{HayasakiMineshige+:2007b,
	Abstract = {We consider accretion flows from circumbinary disks onto supermassive binary black holes on a subparsec scale of the galactic center based on a smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) code. Simulation models are presented for four cases; that is, a circular binary and an eccentric one, each with equal and unequal masses. We find that the circumblack-hole disks are formed around each black hole regardless of the simulation parameters. There are two-step mechanisms that cause accretion flow. First, tidally induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass inflow toward two closest points on the circumbinary disk. Then, the gas is increasingly accumulated on these two points owing to the gravitational attraction of black holes. Second, when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of the effective binary potential, it starts to overflow via their two points, and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular binaries, the gas continues to be supplied from the circumbinary disk, (i.e., the gap 
between the circumbinary disk and the binary black hole is always closed). In eccentric cases, the mass supply undergoes periodic on/off transitions during one orbital period because of the variation of the periodic potential. The gap starts to close after the apoastron, and to open again after the next periastron passage. Due to the gap closing/opening cycles, the mass-capture rates are eventually strongly phase dependent. This could provide observable diagnosis for the presence of supermassive binary black holes in merged galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Circumbinary disks are considered to exist in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, e.g., young binary stars, protoplanetary systems, and massive binary black hole systems in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, there is no definite evidence for the circumbinary disk except for some in a few young binary star systems. In this Letter, we study possible oscillation modes in circumbinary disks around eccentric and circular binaries. We find that prograde, nonaxisymmetric waves are induced in the inner part of the circumbinary disk by the tidal potential of the binary. Such waves would cause variabilities in emission line profiles from circumbinary disks. Because of prograde precession of the waves, the distance between each component of the binary and the inner edge of the circumbinary disk varies with the beat period between the precession period of the wave and the binary orbital period. As a result, light curves from the circumbinary disks are also expected to vary with the same period. The 
current study thus provides a new method to detect circumbinary disks in various astrophysical systems.},

	Abstract = {We combine ionized gas ([N II] lambda6583) and stellar central velocity dispersions for a sample of 345 galaxies, with and without active galactic nuclei (AGNs), to study the dynamical state of the nuclear gas and its physical origin. The gas dispersions strongly correlate with the stellar dispersions over the velocity range of sigma ≈ 30-350 km s-1, such that sigma g /sigma* ≈ 0.6-1.4, with an average value of 0.80. These results are independent of Hubble type (for galaxies from E to Sbc), the presence or absence of a bar, or local galaxy environment. For galaxies of type Sc and later and that have sigma* lsim 40 km s-1, the gas seems to have a minimum threshold of sigma g  ≈ 30 km s-1, such that sigma g /sigma* always exceeds 1. Within the sample of AGNs, sigma g /sigma* increases with nuclear luminosity or Eddington ratio, a possible manifestation of AGN feedback associated with accretion disk winds or outflows. This extra source of nongravitational line broadening should be removed when trying to use sigma g  to estimate sigma*. We show that the mass budget of the narrow-line region (NLR) can be accounted for by mass loss from evolved stars. The kinematics of the gas, dominated by random motions, largely reflect the velocity field of the hot gas in the bulge. Lastly, we offer a simple explanation for the correlation between line width and line luminosity observed in the NLR of AGNs.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between a massive binary and a non-self-gravitating circumbinary accretion disc is considered. The shape of the stationary twisted disc produced by the binary is calculated. It is shown that the inner part of the disc must lie in the binary orbital plane for any value of the viscosity. When the inner disc mid-plane is aligned with the binary orbital plane on the scales of interest and it rotates in the same sense as the binary, the modification to the disc structure and the rate of decay of the binary orbit, assumed circular, caused by tidal exchange of angular momentum with the disc, are calculated. It is shown that the modified disc structure is well described by a self-similar solution of the non-linear diffusion equation governing the evolution of the disc surface density. The calculated time-scale for decay of the binary orbit is always smaller than the `accretion' time-scale t\_acc=m/Msolar (m is the mass of the secondary component, and Msolar is the disc accretion rate), 
and is determined by the ratio of the secondary mass m, assumed to be much smaller than the primary mass, the disc mass inside the initial binary orbit, and the form of viscosity in the disc.},

	Abstract = {In spherical galaxies, binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have difficulty reaching sub-parsec separations due to depletion of stars on orbits that intersect the massive binary---the "final parsec problem." Galaxies that form via major mergers are substantially non-spherical, and it has been argued that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxies might provide stars to the massive binary at a high enough rate to avoid stalling. Here we test that idea by carrying out fully self-consistent merger simulations of galaxies containing central SMBHs. We find hardening rates of the massive binaries that are indeed much higher than in spherical models and essentially independent of the number of particles used in the simulations. Binary eccentricities remain high throughout the simulations. Our results constitute a fully stellar-dynamical solution to the final parsec problem and imply a potentially high rate of events for low-frequency gravitational wave detectors like LISA.},

According to hierarchical galaxy merger models, binary black holes should form frequently, and should be common in the cores of galaxies. The presence of massive black hole binaries has been invoked to explain a number of class properties of different types of galaxies, and in triggering various forms of activity. Coalescing massive black hole binaries are powerful emitters of gravitational waves. The search for such binary black holes is therefore of great interest for several topics in astrophysics ranging from galaxy formation to activity in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Dynamical searches reveal central dark objects with masses \{\$\}\~{}10\^{}6\{\$\}to \{\$\}10\^{}\{9.5\}\{\$\} \msun in the Galaxy, \m31, \mm32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and NGC 4594. Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in \{\$\}\~{}20\backslash\%\{\backslash\$\} of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes 
caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic simulation of a thin, viscous, locally isothermal corotating disk orbiting an equal-mass Newtonian binary point mass on a fixed circular orbit. We study the structure of the disk after multiple viscous times. The binary maintains a central hole in the viscously relaxed disk with radius equal to about twice the binary semimajor axis. Disk surface density within the hole is reduced by orders of magnitude relative to the density in the disk bulk. The inner truncation of the disk resembles the clearing of a gap in a protoplanetary disk. An initially circular disk becomes elliptical and then eccentric. Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is stationary in the rotating frame in which the binary is at rest; this component is a two-armed spiral density wave. We measure the distribution of the binary torque in the disk and find that the strongest positive torque is exerted inside the central low-density hole. We make connection with the 
linear theory of disk forcing at outer Lindblad resonances (OLRs) and find that the measured torque density distribution is consistent with forcing at the 3:2 (m=2) OLR, well within the central hole. We also measure the time dependence of the rate at which gas accretes across the hole and find quasi-periodic structure. We discuss implications for variability and detection of active galactic nuclei containing a binary massive black hole.},

	Abstract = {Binary supermassive black holes are produced by galactic mergers as the black holes from the two galaxies fall to the center of the merged system and form a bound pair. The two black holes will eventually coalesce in an enormous burst of gravitational radiation. Here we show that the orientation of a black hole's spin axis would change dramatically even in a minor merger, leading to a sudden flip in the direction of any associated jet. We identify the winged or X-type radio sources with galaxies in which this has occurred. The inferred coalescence rate is similar to the overall galaxy merger rate, implying that of the order of one merger event per year could be detected by gravitational wave interferometers.},

	Abstract = {In classical loss cone theory, stars are supplied to a central black hole via gravitational scattering onto low angular momentum orbits. Higher feeding rates are possible if the gravitational potential near the black hole is nonaxisymmetric and the orbits are chaotic. Motivated by recently published, self-consistent models, we evaluate rates of stellar capture and disruption in triaxial nuclei. Rates are found to substantially exceed those in collisionally resupplied loss cones, as long as an appreciable fraction of the orbits are centrophilic. The mass captured by a black hole after a given time in a steep ($\rho$\~{}r-2) nucleus scales as $\sigma$5 with $\sigma$ the stellar velocity dispersion, and the accumulated mass in 1010 yr is of the correct order to reproduce the M*-$\sigma$ relation. Triaxiality can solve the ``final parsec problem'' of decaying black hole binaries by increasing the flux of stars into the binary's loss cone.},

The situation arises in galaxies affected by a central bar, in accretion disks in a close binary system, in the disturbance of the asteroid belt by Jupiter, etc. The disk is treated as a continuous network of oscillators, one being in resonance with the satellite. Momentum and continuity equations are defined for the torque and account is taken of the effects of friction and unsteadiness on the torque, and of pressure, viscosity and self-gravitation on waves in disks. Planetary and satellite masses are shown to dominate the magnitude of the torque, while physical processes in the disk affect the torque density at an isolated resonance.},

When two galaxies containing massive black holes merge, a binary forms at the center of the new galaxy. We discuss the evolution of the binary after its separation decreases below one parsec.

	Abstract = {The long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries at the centers of galaxies is studied in a variety of physical regimes, with the aim of resolving the ``final parsec problem,'' i.e., how black hole binaries manage to shrink to separations at which emission of gravity waves becomes efficient. A binary ejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the host galaxy. Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the loss cone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived for collisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantially underestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions for nonequilibrium loss cone dynamics and calculate timescales for the decay of massive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly higher decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation, decay of binaries can persist as a result of repeated ejection of stars returning to 
the nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of stars leads to a gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy on time. We derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the Brownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that numerical N-body experiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times as a result of spurious relaxation.},

	Abstract = {The final merger of a pair of massive black holes in a galactic nucleus is compelled by gravitational radiation. Gravitational waves from the mergers of black holes of masses 105-107(1+z)-1 Msolar at redshifts of 1-20 will be readily detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, but an electromagnetic afterglow would be helpful in pinpointing the source and its redshift. Long before the merger, the binary ``hollows out'' any surrounding gas and shrinks slowly compared to the viscous timescale of a circumbinary disk. The inner gas disk is truncated at the radius where gravitational torque from the binary balances the viscous torque, and accretion onto the black holes is diminished. Initially, the inner truncation radius is able to follow the shrinking binary inward. But eventually the gravitational radiation timescale becomes shorter than the viscous timescale in the disk, leading to a merged black hole surrounded by a hollow disk of gas. We show that the subsequent viscous evolution of 
the hollow, radiation pressure-dominated disk will create an \~{}1043.5(M/106 Msolar) ergs s-1 X-ray source on a timescale \~{}7(1+z)(M/106 Msolar)1.32 yr. This justifies follow-up monitoring of gravitational wave events with next-generation X-ray observatories. Analysis of the detailed light curve of these afterglows will yield new insights into the subtle physics of accretion onto massive black holes.},

	Abstract = {We investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassive black hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. This is known to be problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binary mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric, shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass comparable to that of the secondary black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally super-Eddington for either hole. The coalescence time-scale is therefore always ?, where M2 is 
the secondary black hole mass and ? the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.},

	Abstract = {We consider the interaction between a binary system (e.g. two supermassive black holes or two stars) and an external accretion disc with misaligned angular momentum. This situation occurs in galaxy merger events involving supermassive black holes, and in the formation of stellar--mass binaries in star clusters. We work out the gravitational torque between the binary and disc, and show that their angular momenta J\_b, J\_d stably counteralign if their initial orientation is sufficiently retrograde, specifically if the angle theta between them obeys cos(theta) < -J\_d/2J\_b, on a time short compared with the mass gain time of the central accretor(s). The magnitude J\_b remains unchanged in this process. Counteralignment can promote the rapid merger of supermassive black hole binaries, and possibly the formation of coplanar but retrograde planets around stars in binary systems.},

	Abstract = {The expansion of the field equations of general relativity in powers of the gravitational coupling constant yields conservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. From these, the loss of energy and angular momentum of a system due to the radiation of gravitational waves is found. Two techniques, radiation reaction and flux across a large sphere, are used in these calculations and are shown to be in agreement over a time average. In the nonrelativistic limit, the energy and angular momentum radiation and angular distributions are expressed in terms of time derivatives of the quadrupole tensor Qij. These results are then applied to a bound system of two point masses moving in elliptical orbits. The secular decays of the semimajor axis and eccentricity are found as functions of time, and are integrated to specify the decay by gravitational radiation of such systems as functions of their initial conditions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate a purely stellar dynamical solution to the Final Parsec Problem. Galactic nuclei resulting from major mergers are not spherical, but show some degree of triaxiality. With N-body simulations, we show that equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) hosted by them will continuously interact with stars on centrophilic orbits and will thus inspiral---in much less than a Hubble time---down to separations at which gravitational-wave (GW) emission is strong enough to drive them to coalescence. Such coalescences will be important sources of GWs for future space-borne detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on our results for equal-mass mergers, and given that the hardening rate of unequal-mass binaries is similar, we expect that LISA will see between \~{}10 and \~{} few × 102 such events every year, depending on the particular massive black hole (MBH) seed model as obtained in recent studies of merger trees of galaxy and MBH co-evolution. Orbital 
eccentricities in the LISA band will be clearly distinguishable from zero with e >\~{} 0.001-0.01.},

The major uncertainties in accretion disk theory are the dissipation process (viscosity) and the emission process. It is noted that disk modeling is in some sense more an art than a science, and since a steady disk can be constructed for almost any combination of viscosity and radiation processes, the possibilities are almost endless. Conversely, it is likely that more can be learned about the properties of accretion disks in astrophysics by observation and subsequent modeling than by pure theorizing.},

	Abstract = {The radio source Sagittarius A* at the center of our Galaxy is believed to be a 2.6×106 Msolar black hole that accretes gas from the winds of nearby stars. We show that limits on the X-ray and infrared emission from the Galactic center provide an upper limit of ~8×10-5 Msolar yr-1 on the mass accretion rate in Sgr A*. The advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model favors a rate of <~10-5 Msolar yr-1. In comparison, the Bondi accretion rate onto Sgr A*, estimated using the observed spatial distribution of mass-losing stars and assuming noninteracting stellar winds, is ~3×10-5 Msolar yr-1. Thus, there is rough agreement between the Bondi, the ADAF, and the X-ray-inferred accretion rates for Sgr A*. We discuss uncertainties in these estimates, emphasizing the importance of upcoming observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory for tightening the X-ray-derived limits.},

	Abstract = {The stellar ejection rate and the rates of change of the binary semimajor axis and eccentricity are derived from scattering experiments for the restricted three-body problem. They are used to study the evolution of binaries in simple models for galactic nuclei, starting soon after the black holes become bound and continuing until the evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational radiation or until the ejected mass is too large for the galaxy to be considered fixed. The eccentricity growth is found to be unimportant unless the binary forms with a large eccentricity. The scattering results suggest that a binary with masses m\_1>=m\_2 should not be considered hard until its orbital velocity exceeds the background velocity dispersion by a factor that scales as (1+m\_1/m\_2)\^{}1/2. The results are compared with predictions from Chandrasekhar's dynamical-friction formula and with previous work on the capture and scattering of comets by planetary systems.},

	Abstract = {We study the dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries embedded in circumbinary gaseous discs, with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. The subparsec binary (of total mass M and mass ratio q= 1/3) has excavated a gap and transfers its angular momentum to the self-gravitating disc (Mdisc= 0.2M). We explore the changes of the binary eccentricity, e, by simulating a sequence of binary models that differ in the initial eccentricity e0 only. In initially low-eccentric binaries, the eccentricity increases with time, while in high-eccentric binaries e declines, indicating the existence of a limiting eccentricity ecrit that is found to fall in the interval [0.6, 0.8]. We also present an analytical interpretation for this saturation limit. An important consequence of the existence of ecrit is the detectability of a significant residual eccentricity eLISA by the proposed gravitational wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It is found that at the moment of entering the 
LISA frequency domain eLISA� 10-3-10-2, a signature of its earlier coupling with the massive circumbinary disc. We also observe large periodic inflows across the gap, occurring on the binary and disc dynamical time-scales rather than on the viscous time. These periodic changes in the accretion rate (with amplitudes up to �100 per cent, depending on the binary eccentricity) can be considered a fingerprint of eccentric subparsec binaries migrating inside a circumbinary disc.},

	Abstract = {We outline the eccentricity evolution of sub-parsec massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) forming in galaxy mergers. In both stellar and gaseous environments, MBHBs are expected to grow large orbital eccentricities before they enter the gravitational wave (GW) observational domain. We re--visit the predicted eccentricities detectable by space based laser interferometers (as the proposed ELISA/NGO) for both environments. Close to coalescence, many MBHBs will still maintain detectable eccentricities, spanning a broad range from <10\^{}\{-5\} up to <\~{} 0.5. Stellar and gas driven dynamics lead to distinct distributions, with the latter favoring larger eccentricities. At larger binary separations, when emitted GWs will be observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), the expected eccentricities are usually quite large, in the range 0.01-0.7, which poses an important issue for signal modelling and detection algorithms. In this window, large eccentricities also have implications on proposed electromagnetic 
counterparts to the GW signal, which we briefly review.},

	Abstract = {The quasar 3C 273 is a well-known superluminal source. More than 10 radio components have been detected moving away from the nucleus with different superluminal speeds and position angles. The pattern of ejection suggests the existence of a precessing inner jet, whose kinematics has been discussed by Abraham \{\&\} Romero (1999). We now present a binary black hole model for the central engine of 3C 273 where the rapid precession is tidally induced in the primary accretion disk inner region by a secondary black hole in a non-coplanar orbit. Using $\gamma$- and X-ray data we estimate upper limits for the mass of the primary, and then we compute the relevant parameters of the system for a variety of disk models. We also discuss some of the implications of the model for the electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from 3C 273.},

	Abstract = {We apply the binary black hole model to explain the wiggles in the milliarcsec radio jet of the superluminal quasar 1928 + 738 (4C 73.18) observed with VLBI at 1.3 cm wavelength by Hummel et al. (1992). The period and amplitude of the wiggles can be explained as due to the orbital motion of a binary black hole with mass of order l0 exp 8 solar masses, mass ratio larger than 0.1, and orbital radius about 10 exp 16 cm. The jet's inclination to the line of sight should be small confirming the standard interpretation of superluminal motion and one-sidedness as due to relativistic motion in a direction close to the line of sight. The small orbital radius suggests that the binary has been losing a significant amount of orbital energy during the last 10 exp 7 yr, possibly by interaction with the matter which is flowing through the active galactic nucleus. The arcsec-scale radio structure provides additional support for a link between activity and binary evolution. If our interpretation of the mass 
wiggle in this quasar is correct, then many other quasars may contain massive binary black holes as well.},

	Abstract = {Tidal torques from a binary black hole empty out the central regions in any circumbinary gaseous accretion disk. The balance between tidal torques and viscosity maintain the inner edge of the disk at a radius \{\&\}rtilde;1.5a-2a, where a is the binary semimajor axis. Eventually, the inspiraling binary decouples from the disk and merges, leaving behind a central hollow (``donut hole'') in the disk orbiting the remnant black hole. We present a simple, time-dependent, Newtonian calculation that follows the secular (viscous) evolution of the disk as it fills up the hollow down to the black hole innermost stable circular orbit and then relaxes to stationary equilibrium. We use our model to calculate the electromagnetic radiation (``afterglow'') spectrum emitted during this transient accretion epoch. Observing the temporal increase in the total electromagnetic flux and the hardening of the spectrum as the donut hole fills may help confirm a binary black hole merger detected by a gravitational wave 
interferometer. We show how the very existence of the initial hollow can lead to super-Eddington accretion during this secular phase if the rate is not very far below Eddington prior to decoupling. Our model, though highly idealized, may be useful in establishing some of the key parameters, thermal emission features and scalings that characterize this transient. It can serve as a guide in the design and calibration of future radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity.},

@article{SpringelMatteo+:2005a,
	Abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs 
markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r\~{}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

@article{ThorneBraginskii:1976a,
	Abstract = {It is argued that the collapse which forms the supermassive black holes that are likely to exist in the nuclei of many quasars and galaxies, and collisions between those holes, should produce strong broadband bursts of gravitational waves. The mean time between such gravitational-wave bursts at earth is analyzed in terms of the present Hubble expansion rate, the present deceleration parameter of the universe, the redshift z = 2.5 (at which most of the bursts are assumed to have been generated), the present number density of 'centers' where the bursts originated, the mean number of bursts generated in each center during its active life, and the speed of light. The analysis shows that the range from one week to 300 years is reasonable for the time between bursts, although it is admitted that hardly any bursts at all is also reasonable. Expected characteristics of the bursts are deduced, and it is shown that the best detector for these bursts will probably be Doppler tracking of one or more 
interplanetary spacecraft.},

	Abstract = {Only a small fraction of local galaxies harbor an accreting black hole, classified as an active galactic nucleus. However, many stellar systems are plausibly expected to host black holes, from globular clusters to nuclear star clusters, to massive galaxies. The mere presence of stars in the vicinity of a black hole provides a source of fuel via mass loss of evolved stars. In this paper, we assess the expected luminosities of black holes embedded in stellar systems of different sizes and properties, spanning a large range of masses. We model the distribution of stars and derive the amount of gas available to a central black hole through a geometrical model. We estimate the luminosity of the black holes under simple, but physically grounded, assumptions on the accretion flow. Finally, we discuss the detectability of "quiescent" black holes in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z\~{}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z\~{}20 from high-? density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until 
the present in a ?CDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1<z<5. A scheme for describing the hardening of a BH binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing <\~{}10 percent to the 
total BH mass density, ?SMBH=4?105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10 percent today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3 percent at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 ? (4 ?) density peaks at z=20.},

@article{Ward:1997a,
	Abstract = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts relative to disk material on a time scale inversely proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk material. A density discontinuity that locks the protoplanet into the 
disk's viscous evolution develops across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies the relationship between these migration types and reveals under what circumstances a given type is selected is presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications to the issue of planetary formation are discussed.},

@article{YangWang+:2013a,
	Abstract = {We present results of follow-up optical spectroscopic Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) observations of seven rare, extreme coronal line-emitting galaxies reported by Wang et al. Large variations in coronal lines are found in four objects, making them strong candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). For the four TDE candidates, all the coronal lines with ionization states higher than [Fe VII] disappear within 5-9 yr. The [Fe VII] line faded by a factor of about five in one object (J0952+2143) within 4 yr, whereas the line emerged in another two objects that previously did not show the line. A strong increment in the [O III] flux is observed, shifting the line ratios toward the loci of active galactic nuclei on the BPT diagram. Surprisingly, we detect a non-canonical [O III] lambda5007/[O III] lambda4959 ratio of ~= 2 in two objects, indicating a large column density of O2 + and thus probably optically thick gas. This result also requires a very large ionization parameter and a relatively soft ionizing spectral energy distribution (e.g., a blackbody with T < 5 × 104 K). Our observations can be explained as the echoing of a strong ultraviolet to soft X-ray flare caused by TDEs on molecular clouds in the inner parsecs of the galactic nuclei. Reanalyzing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra reveals double-peaked or strongly blue-shouldered broad lines in three of the objects, which disappeared in the MMT spectra of two objects and faded by a factor of 10 in 8 yr in the remaining object with a decrease in both the line width and centroid offset. We interpret these broad lines as arising from decelerating biconical outflows. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of echoing can persist for as long as 10 yr and can be used to probe the gas environment in quiescent galactic nuclei.},

@article{ZierBiermann:2002a,
	Abstract = {In this second paper, in a series of two, we determine the properties of the stellar torus that we showed in the first paper to result as a product of two merging black holes. If the surrounding stellar cluster is as massive as the binary black hole, the torque acting on the stars ejects a fraction which extracts the binary's angular momentum. After the black holes coalesced on scales of \~{} 107ut \{yr\}, a geometrically thick torus remained. In the present article we show that a certain fraction of the stars has winds, shaped into elongated tails by the central radiation pressure, which are optically thick for line of sights aligned with them. These stars are sufficiently numerous to achieve a covering factor of 1, so that the complete torus is optically thick. This patchy structured torus is then compared with observations. We find the parameters of such a torus to be just in the right range in order to explain the observed large column densities in AGN and their temporal variations on time 
scales of about a decade. Within this model the broad absorption line quasars can be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate inclination angles, with the line of sight grazing the edge of the torus. The half-opening angle of the torus is wider for major mergers and thus correlates with the central luminosity, as has been suggested previously. In this picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly dominated by the orbital angular momentum of the binary. Thus the spin of the merged black hole points into a new direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flip according to the spin-paradigm. This re-orientation could be an explanation for the X-shaped radio galaxies, and the advancing of a new jet through the ambient medium for Compact Symmetric Objects.},
